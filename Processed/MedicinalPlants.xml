<pb n="v"/></p></div1><div1 id="trans" type="Preface"><head>Translator&#8217;s Preface.</head><p>This translation was undertaken with the especial object of facilitating the study of the native medicinal plants by the numerous medical officers stationed at small posts throughout the Philippines. In order to aid in the recognition of these plants, the botanical descriptions have been revised to the extent of adding, where possible, the size and shape of the plant, English name, length of leaves, color of flowers, etc., in many instances supplying the entire botanical description where it had been omitted on account of general familiarity with the plant. Comparing the few analyses that I have had an opportunity to make with corresponding ones in the native works from which Dr. Tavera has taken his botanical descriptions, I am impressed with the necessity for a revision of the Botany of the Philippines. However, as the therapeutic properties of the flora are of foremost interest to the medical profession I have not hesitated to publish the book in its present form as an entering wedge, leaving to those better fitted the great work of classifying the flora of these islands in accordance with modern botanical science.
</p><p>Dr. Tavera has faithfully described the Malay and Hindu therapeutics of the present day, enriching his description by observations founded on a long practice in Paris and in his own native Luzon. From this potpourri of scientific therapeutics and ignorant, superstitious drugging the interested physician will elicit not a few useful data concerning the treatment of disease in the tropics, and at the same time gain a more intimate knowledge of both the people and plants of our new Asiatic possessions.
</p><p>I take this occasion to gratefully acknowledge my obligations to Mr. A. P. Tonielli, stenographer and translator of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, for typewriting the manuscript of this translation.

<pb n="vii"/></p></div1><div1 id="preface" type="Preface"><head>Preface.</head><p>Commissioned by His Majesty&#8217;s Government to study the medicinal plants of my native country, I returned there and spent two years in collecting data regarding the use that the Filipinos make of their plants in the treatment of disease. At the same time I collected and carefully preserved some with the purpose of taking them to Europe, to study their chemical composition in the laboratories of Paris under the direction of the eminent men who had been my instructors in medicine.
</p><p>The work I did in the Philippines was preliminary, a preparation for the more extended study of the subject which I wished to make in Paris, where I went with my notes and collection. Unfortunately, upon leaving Manila, I confided the mounting and pressing of my plants to an inexperienced person who stupidly placed in the midst of them several succulent tubers which decomposed during the voyage and spoiled the other plants. At the same time I received in Paris an important collection of the vegetable drugs of the Philippines, sent by my friend the pharmacist, M. Rosedo Garcia, and destined for the World&#8217;s Fair of 1889. I opened with great pleasure the wood and zinc box in which the collection came, anticipating that I should be able to carry out my plan of study and at the same time win for my friend, Garcia, a well-deserved premium. Imagine my disappointment upon finding that, by an unfortunate coincidence, his plants had arrived in the same condition as mine, having also been packed with tubers of ubi, gabi, etc., and several cocoanuts which had decomposed.
</p><p>Many times since then I have tried to obtain from Manila, through exchange or payment of money, a similar collection, but have been unable to secure a single leaf of the plants I so <pb n="viii"/>desired. If in the future I have the good fortune to procure any, I shall make a study of those at hand and publish the results.
</p><p>I herewith publish the results of my investigations and experiments in Manila, where, especially in the neighboring towns of San Mateo and San Miguel, I often had opportunities for using, with good results, the plants of which this volume treats. I may add that in spite of the limited means at my disposal in Manila and the short time left me by my regular occupations I was able to conduct a few laboratory experiments owing to which this work contains some personal observations reinforcing those quoted from medical literature.
</p><p>The flora of the Archipelago is known to-day through the works of Fathers Blanco, Llanos, Fernandez del Villar and Naves, and of the engineers Jordano, the brothers Vidal and Soler and others who have brought such honor to Spanish science, preparing the way for the study of the therapeutic and industrial applications of that wonderfully rich plant life with which our islands have been endowed. Their works help us to recognize the plants whose medicinal virtues are herein described and it is to them I owe the botanical descriptions in this treatise.
</p><p>Father Blanco, in describing certain plants, mentions their medicinal uses in the Philippines, but his descriptions are few and very deficient as one would expect in a work of the scope of his Flora. A Jesuit of some reputation, Father Clain, published in Manila in 1712 a book entitled &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Remedios f&#225;ciles para diferentes enfermedades?</foreign>&#8221; in which he speaks of the medicinal virtues of some of the indigenous plants, almost the same ones that appear in another work, a frank and pleasing little treatise written by Father Santa Maria. Father Mercado is the only one who has written a special treatise on the subject and his manuscript remained unedited until the Augustinian Fathers of Manila published it in the last edition of <pb n="ix"/>Father Blanco&#8217;s &#8220;Flora&#8221;; but neither this work nor those of Clain or Santa Maria are useful to a physician, nor are they as accurately written as works of a scientific character should be. From time to time superficial articles have appeared in the Manila papers regarding the virtues of some plant or other and these books and articles comprise the whole literature on the subject up to this time.
</p><p>Some physicians regard with small favor the therapeutic application of plants by the Filipino &#8220;herb-doctors&#8221; (<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">curanderos</foreign>) as being entirely empirical. This disparagement is unjustified because in all the most rational and scientific remedies that we make use of, the first step towards the final development of their relative position among remedies is due to empiricism which is founded on daily experience, on observation of results obtained in specific cases, facts that are handed down from father to son for generations. The scientific explanation is lacking, but those first ideas frequently owing their origin to chance, or, perhaps, to superstition, have often been based upon the observation of facts which, although fortuitous, are none the less positive.
</p><p>Many of the plants mentioned in this book are official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India and we see no reason why their use should be proscribed in the Philippines. Filipino physicians not only can but should employ many indigenous plants in their therapeutics; in many instances they would find them more useful than the exotics, which are not always fresh and are commonly reduced in strength by long keeping or damaged by some circumstance of voyage or climate. The price is another argument in favor of the use of native drugs. If the pharmacists would prepare extracts and keep on hand the crude drugs most in demand the public would gain a great advantage and the druggists be well repaid for their labor. Physicians and pharmacists will surely understand these advantages and when finally one considers that the patients generally prefer to be <pb n="x"/>treated with native plants, I feel justified in the hope that their use will spread rapidly in the Philippines.
</p><p>To employ therapeutically the drugs described in this work is not to experiment &#8220;<foreign lang="la" xml:lang="la">in anima vilis</foreign>,&#8221; as some would have us believe. To experiment is to employ unknown remedies of unknown virtues and properties.
</p><p>In this treatise I am not attempting to fix the indications for this or that product, but simply make known the diseases in which the Filipinos and the natives of other countries employ the products. Any physician has a perfect right to prescribe these drugs, as have also the &#8220;curanderos&#8221; and even the laity, with this difference, however, that the physician is capable of observing results and guiding himself by the physiologic action of the drugs. His knowledge of the physiologic and anatomo-pathologic problems of the human body, will enable the physician to make scientific inferences that would be hidden from the common &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">curandero</foreign>.&#8221;
</p><p>As neither the Manila nor the provincial physicians keep these medicinal plants in stock, with the exception of those that are official in the European and American pharmacop&#339;ias, it will be necessary for the physician who wishes to use them, to busy himself with seeking them and laying in a sufficient stock to serve him when the opportunity presents itself. It is necessary to preserve them by drying and this is best done by exposing them several days to the fresh air in a dry place&#8212;for example, the corridors of the house&#8212;being careful not to expose them to the rays of the sun, in which latter event the fleshy and juicy plants which do not desiccate rapidly, putrefy or ferment.
</p><p>A convenient way to get them is to visit the Binondo Square where there has been market for native drugs from time immemorial. The gardeners from the neighboring towns, especially those from Pasay and Singalon, regularly offer the plants for sale and will undertake to supply you with any that <pb n="xi"/>may not be on hand. Inasmuch as the common names of the plants lead to many mistakes and much confusion, it is indispensable to acquaint one&#8217;s self with the description of the plant and be sure that the actual product conforms in all respects to the description. For this purpose it is well to obtain flowering specimens, and bearing this fact in mind I have been careful to indicate the flowering season of each plant. By making excursions to the towns of San Mateo and Angono I have obtained an abundance of whatever I sought and at the same time have learned by talking with the mountaineers and &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">curanderos</foreign>,&#8221; what uses they make of their plants. The &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">curanderos</foreign>&#8221; know a great deal concerning these uses, but become very reticent as soon as they are questioned about them. Whether it is dread of ridicule or selfishness or fear that silences them, the fact remains that it is no easy matter to glean any useful facts from them. And yet by tact and friendliness one may elicit much more information from them than first impressions would lead one to hope.
</p><p>Leaves should be gathered when fully developed, rejecting the old, dried and worm-eaten ones.
</p><p>The best time to gather bark is one month before the period of inflorescence, when it is rich in sap. The flowers are best gathered when about half expanded. The fruit is gathered green or ripe according to the active principle sought. The seeds should always be mature.
</p><p>Not all parts of the plant are equally provided with the active principle which may be localized in the root or the flower; or distinct principles may exist in different parts of the same plant. Therefore the part indicated, and only that part, should be employed.
</p><p>In the root the active substance usually resides in the bark, sometimes in the parenchyma that envelopes the woody tissue and rarely in the woody tissue itself, as, for example, in &#8220;rhubarb&#8221; and &#8220;pareira brava.&#8221;
<pb n="xii"/></p><p>The stem bark is also a frequent seat of the active principle, of which the outer portion contains the greater amount, according to the valuable experiments of Howard.
</p><p>Some plants owe their therapeutic importance to their wood, others to their leaves or flowers, and regarding the localization of the active principle in these parts we have nothing especial to indicate. The fruit, however, may have a pericarp consisting of mucilage, starch, sugar and gum, etc., while the seeds contain fatty matter, fixed or essential oils or alkaloids, as is the case with coffee and cacao. In view of these facts, we repeat that it is indispensable to use that part of each plant which I have indicated as applicable to a determined case or condition.
</p><p>I earnestly hope that the physicians and pharmacists practising in the Philippines may undertake investigations and experiments regarding the therapeutic properties of the plants of my native land, and that my endeavors may have acted as a stimulus or inspiration to the loyal and earnest study of the subjects that are now awakening such interest, not only in Europe and America, but in India and Japan.
</p><p>I should be pleased to receive notes, plants or reports of researches from any one interested in the subject matter of this book, and I shall consider it a pleasure, as well as a duty, to devote my forces, small as they may be, to aiding any one who may do me the honor to claim my assistance.

It is used as an infusion internally in the h&#230;moptysis of consumptives, and externally in the treatment of sore throat, its action being due to the large amount of tannin it contains. It is also employed in Malabar in the form of an infusion of the leaves of the species, <hi>T. Rheedi</hi>, to treat sore throat, mixing it with a decoction of rice called <hi>cange</hi>.
</p><p>The Filipinos do not distinguish this species from the <hi>T. Assa</hi>.
</p><p>Both are called <hi>malakatm&#243;n</hi>, and are employed indiscriminately to accomplish the same results. The silicious concretion obtained from the leaves is used as a polish in the form of polish paper.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;Although this plant does not grow in the Philippines, the use of its fruit is so common there that it demands a place in this work. It is employed chiefly as a condiment in the preparation of food, and its essential oil is used to prepare the native &#8220;anise cordial&#8221; by mixing it with alcohol obtained from the palm or from sugar cane.
</p><p>The decoction of the fruit is given after meals as a tea-like beverage, to aid digestion or for its carminative effect in flatulent colic.
</p><p>Star anise has an aromatic taste, slightly bitter and acrid, and a very marked perfume of anise which with its star-like form gives the plant one of its names. It is a very useful stimulant, tonic, stomachic and carminative.
</p><p>It is official in all Pharmacop&#339;ias and the pericarp is the part employed.
</p><p>The dose is from 1 to 2 grams to 100 of water in infusion, to be taken in one draught.
</p><p>According to Schlegel it contains the following substances: An essential oil 4.675; a green waxy material which melts at 51&#176;, a resin, a gum and saponin. The essential oil is (almost) identical with that of anise from which it is impossible to distinguish it chemically. The only difference is that the former has a blander odor and solidifies at 1&#176;.25 instead of 10&#176;, as does the oil of anise.
<pb id="pb19" n="19"/></p><p><hi rend="sc">Botanical Description.</hi>&#8212;The plant grows in the mountains of Yunnan, China, and in Tonquin. The part used in the Philippines is the fruit, being indeed the only part known here. This is composed of 8 woody follicles arranged about a central column in the form of a star. These follicles open at maturity and reveal the seeds, which are shining, smooth, ovoid, hard, of a pretty chestnut-red color. In the Philippines they are sold even in the smallest food-vending shops.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The bark of the trunk is well known as a febrifuge and emmenagogue in India. It is slightly bitter and aromatic. Dr. H.

</p><p>An astringent decoction made from the leaves is used as a gargle in sore throat. The root is emmenagogue and the seeds are used in the treatment of anal fissure.
</p><p>Dr. Hooper has found the following substances in the bark of the <hi>Champana</hi>: a volatile oil with a pine-like odor; a fixed oil, insoluble in alcohol, melting at 15&#176; and forming soap with soda; a resin extremely bitter, acrid, brown in color; tannin; sugar; a bitter principle, albuminoids, coloring matters, mucilage and starch.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The fruit of this species is neither as much prized nor as abundant in the Philippines as that of the ates. When unripe it possesses the same properties as the latter. The large proportion of tannin which both species contain in their unripe state, makes them very useful in treating diarrh&#339;a and dysentery. They are administered in the form of a decoction, by enema. The sap of the trunk is very irritating. The roots are used by the American Indians to treat epilepsy. Lemon juice is the antidote for the sap of this species.
</p><p>I wish to call attention to the similarity of the common name of this plant to another entirely distinct species commonly used in the Tagalo therapeutics; namely, the <hi>anonag&#771;</hi> (Cordia), with which it must not be confused.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;Makabuhay is one of the most widely known and used plants in the Philippines; a sort of panacea applied to all bodily afflictions. Its Tagalo name means literally &#8220;you may live.&#8221; A shoot deprived of roots and dropped in some moist place is soon covered with bright green leaves and adventitious roots. This peculiarity of the plant made it possible for me to take a large number of sprouts from Manila to Paris where they arrived perfectly fresh after a voyage of forty days, during which they lay almost forgotten in the ship and the cars.
</p><p>The stem is the part employed in medicine. A decoction is given internally in the various forms of malarial fever and of dyspepsia. Externally it is most useful as a wash for ulcers of all kinds, rapidly improving their appearance.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;One of the uses to which the India berries (<hi>Cocas de Levante</hi>) are put in the Philippines, is to throw them into small sluggish streams or into lakes with the object of intoxicating the fish which soon come to the surface and float there as if dead. This custom is very extensive in Malaysia, in India and even in Europe, where, in order to avoid the cases of poisoning which this practice has occasioned in the consumers of fish taken in this way, it has been found necessary to forbid the sale of the berries except in the pharmacies. These restrictions are practiced in France.
</p><p>In the Binondo market in Manila the root of this plant may be found in abundance; it is yellow and very bitter. The natives use the infusion (5&#8211;10 grams to 300 cc. of water) in fevers, dyspepsia and menstrual derangements. In India also the root is used in the same complaints.
</p><p>The fruit contains the highly toxic principle <hi>picrotoxin</hi>, and others as follows:
</p><p><hi>Menispermin</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">18</hi>H<hi rend="sub">24</hi>N<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is an alkaloid which crystallizes in pyramidal prisms, is soluble in alcohol and ether and insoluble in water.

No odor, taste bitter, insoluble in water, partly soluble in alcohol and in ether, freely soluble in acids and alkalies. A solution in concentrated sulphuric acid has a saffron-yellow color. Nitric acid transforms it into oxalic acid.
<pb id="pb25" n="25"/></p><p><hi>Picrotoxinin</hi> exists in picrotoxin in the proportion of 32 to 100, and may be separated by boiling in benzine.

</p><p>The negros of Senegal use the decoction of the root to cure gonorrh&#339;a.

</p><p>The English physicians of India state that it is dangerous to use the milky juice as an application to the eye, although Dymock claims the contrary.
</p><p>The flowers are narcotic by virtue of a principle resembling morphine, perhaps identical with that alkaloid.
</p><p>The seeds yield a fixed oil on expression, which is laxative and relieves the pains of colic, probably by virtue of its narcotic properties. Physicians in India praise this oil highly; not only is it a sure and painless purgative, but it is free from the viscidity and disgusting taste of castor-oil; besides it has the advantage of operating in small doses, 2&#8211;4 grams. Its activity is proportionate to its freshness. Dr. W. O&#8217;Shaughnessy does not value this oil highly, but the experience of many distinguished physicians of India has proved the purgative and other properties that have just been mentioned. Possibly the differences of opinion may arise from the fact that oils from different plants were used in the trials.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Botanical Description.</hi>&#8212;The mangosteen grows only in the southern islands of the Archipelago and its delicious fruit is the part of the plant known in Manila. The peel is at the present time almost universally employed in medicine. The fruit is about the size of a small Manila orange, the pericarp a dark red or chocolate color, tough and thick, crowned with the remains of the calyx. On breaking it open the edible portion of the fruit is seen, consisting of 6&#8211;18 seeds covered by a white, sweet pulp, cottony in appearance, of a delicious slightly acrid flavor.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Nom. Vulg.</hi>&#8212;I do not know the name given by the Filipinos to this tree, which Vidal and Soler have seen in Montalv&#225;n, Tiwi (Albay) and San Mateo (Province of Manila); but it is highly important in medicine as the true gamboge is obtained from it. <hi>Gamboge Tree</hi>, Eng.
</p><p>The Gamboge of the U. S. P. and B. P. is obtained from <pb id="pb37" n="37"/><hi>G. Hanburii</hi> which differs somewhat botanically from <hi>G. morella</hi>.
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;All parts of the plant contain a thick, yellow, milky juice which constitutes the gamboge. In Malabar, Ceylon, Canara and Singapore the following method of extraction is followed: At the beginning of the rainy season a spiral incision is made around the bark of about half the tree trunk, and a piece of bamboo is fixed in place to collect the juice which slowly exudes from the cut for several months, soon becoming viscid and then solid after contact with the air. One tree, as a rule, yields enough sap to fill three internodal segments of bamboo, each 50 cm. long by 3&#8211;5 cm. in diameter.
</p><p>Gamboge is a laxative in doses of 10&#8211;15 cgm., produces abundant evacuations with violent colicky pains in doses of 30&#8211;50 cgm., and is an irritant poison in large doses. In other words it is a highly energetic hydragogue cathartic, especially indicated when we wish to drain off the fluid element of the blood, as in dropsy, asthma, pulmonary and cerebral congestion. It is also used as a vermifuge.
</p><p>It is rarely given alone, but is combined with calomel, aloes, jalap, rhubarb, etc.
</p><p>It is official in all pharmacop&#339;ias.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;This tree yields an oleo resin, used in medicine and known under the name of <hi>b&#225;lsamo de gurjun</hi>. Other species of <hi>Dipterocarpus</hi> (<hi>D. alatus</hi>, Roxb.; <hi>D. incanus</hi>, Roxb.; <hi>D. trinervis</hi>, Bl., etc., etc.) produce the same substance. Balsam of Gurjun is a stimulant of the mucous membranes, especially <pb id="pb41" n="41"/>those of the genito-urinary tract, and is diuretic. It is also indicated in bronchial catarrh and as a local application in ulcer. The first to recommend the use of gurjun as a substitute for copaiba was Sir W. O&#8217;Shaughnessy in 1838, and in 1852 this property was confirmed by Waring with highly satisfactory results. Dr. Enderson of Glasgow employed it in cases that received no benefit from copaiba, giving a teaspoonful t. i. d. in emulsion. Dr. Rean also classed it as equal to copaiba in efficiency.
</p><p>The daily dose ranges from 5&#8211;20 grams, in liquid or pill.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Dose.</hi>&#8212;6&#8211;12 large spoonfuls each day, for the declining stage of gonorrh&#339;a.
</p><p>In Burmah they extract the balsam by the following method: A large hole is cut in the trunk of the tree and a fire is built in this cavity and kept up till the wood of the trunk begins to burn, by which time the oleo resin has collected in abundance in the segments of bamboo placed to receive it. When the exudate diminishes, fire is again placed in the cavity and one tree may tolerate 2, 3 or even 4 of these cavities. The exudate on standing separates into 2 parts; a solid called &#8220;guad&#8221; which forms the lower layer, and a supernatant liquid which is the balsam. It is dense, viscid and very fluorescent; opaque and gray-green by reflected light. It has an odor similar to that of copaiba, is bitter and aromatic. Its density is 0.964. It is soluble in benzine, in bisulphuret of carbon, chloroform, the essential oils and less so in ether and acetic acid. It becomes <pb id="pb42" n="42"/>turbid and coagulates if it be kept at 100&#176; for some time and it solidifies at 200&#176;, while copaiba remains liquid at this temperature.
</p><p>A specimen of the balsam examined by Fl&#252;ckiger consisted of 54.44 parts semifluid resin and 45.56 volatile material. Upon distillation it yields an essential oil, of slight odor, straw-colored; formula C<hi rend="sub">20</hi>H<hi rend="sub">32</hi> (Werner). If purified its density is 0.915. It is soluble in amylic alcohol, scarcely so in absolute alcohol. Hydrochloric acid colors it a beautiful blue.

The leaves are used in bronchial troubles and the seeds are sudorific. The negroes in the United States use the root bark in large doses as an abortifacient; but a dose of 60 grams to 1,200 of water in decoction is proper and useful in treating dysmenorrh&#339;a.
</p><p>For a long time the seeds went to waste but industry has learned to obtain from them a brownish-red oil which is used as a substitute for olive oil, from which it is hard to distinguish it, if the latter is adulterated by mixing the two; for both have the same density and a very similar odor and taste. For this reason the production of cottonseed oil is very considerable nowadays. It is cheap and excellent for domestic, industrial and pharmaceutic use.
</p><p>The seeds are used in North America in dysentery and as a galactagogue, and the juice of the leaves as an emollient in diarrh&#339;a and mild dysentery. The pulp of the seeds, after the oil is extracted, yields a sweet material called <hi>gossypose</hi>, which is dextrogyrous and has the formula C<hi rend="sub">18</hi>H<hi rend="sub">32</hi>O<hi rend="sub">16</hi> + 5H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O.
</p><p>The cotton itself, the part used in commerce as a textile, is also the portion of the plant most widely employed in therapeutics; not only the fiber from this species is used, but also that of others that grow in the Philippines, the <hi>G.

</p><p>Cotton is used extensively in bacteriological laboratories as a filter of liquids and gases. This property possessed by cotton, of retaining in its fibers the germs of the air was utilized by the famous French surgeon Gu&#233;rin in the treatment that bears his name. The denuded surfaces exposed to infection by airborne bacteria are completely protected against them when, according to the Gu&#233;rin treatment, they are enveloped in large masses of fresh, raw cotton, presumably free from micro&#246;rganisms. To avoid the possibility of infection by the cotton itself, it is now the practice to sterilize it either by means of chemicals such as carbolic acid, iodoform, etc., or by physical means such as high temperatures.
</p><p>Raw cotton is used in compounding gun cotton or explosive cotton, also named <hi>pyroxylin</hi>, and this is used to make collodion, so extensively employed in medicine.
</p><p>Pyroxylin is made by treating cotton with equal parts of nitric and sulphuric acids, then washing with water till the latter ceases to give a precipitate with chloride of baryta; then dry in the air.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The roasted bean ground with sugar constitutes chocolate, one of the most generally used foods of the Philippines.
</p><p>It is very nutritious by virtue of the fat and sugar it contains, but all stomachs do not bear it well and its use is the unsuspected cause of much dyspepsia. The custom of drinking it very hot and following with a large quantity of cold water is a very common cause of dilatation of the stomach in the Philippines. The seed of the cacao contains several substances: cacao butter, albumin, theobromine, starch, glucose, gum, tartaric acid, free or combined, tannin, and mineral substances. Of these the butter and theobromine are the most important.
<pb id="pb56" n="56"/></p><p>Theobromine (C<hi rend="sub">7</hi>H<hi rend="sub">8</hi>N<hi rend="sub">4</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is a weak alkaloid, crystalline, slightly bitter, slightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in hot water, less soluble in alcohol and ether; stable in the air up to 100&#176;; sublimes without decomposition at 290&#176; in microscopic crystals of the form of rhomboid prisms ending in an octohedric point (Keller).
</p><p>This alkaloid is very little used in therapeutics and its physiological action is said to be analogous to that of caffeine but weaker. It is better to use the salt of the alkaloid, and that most frequently employed is the salicylate of soda and theobromine in doses of from 2 to 6 grams daily in solution or pill. Lately, however, Dr. Gram has maintained that theobromine is a powerful diuretic operating when other diuretics fail and further that this effect is produced without injuring the heart. The double salt is non-toxic, though sometimes in exceedingly weak patients it produces vertigo. Dr. Gram administers 6 grams a day in one-gram doses.
</p><p>Cacao butter is a white substance, slightly yellowish, unctuous to the touch, brittle; with the agreeable odor peculiar to cacao, and a sweet and pleasant taste. Its density is 0.961, it melts at 30&#176;&#8211;33&#176;, and solidifies at 25&#176;. It dissolves in 20 parts of boiling alcohol, in 100 parts of cold alcohol and in twice its weight of benzin. Cacao butter is obtained by grinding or mashing the roasted seeds in a hot apparatus and mixing the mass with a fifth or tenth of its weight of boiling water. It is then pressed between two hot iron plates and the butter thus obtained is refined by boiling water. It is then put aside in earthen pans, or still better, in moulds, where it solidifies. It does not easily become rancid and, for this reason, enters into the composition of many ointments and pomades, or is used alone. It serves as the base for suppositories and is, finally, a highly valued cosmetic. A common substitute is made by mixing oil of almonds, wax and animal fat.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The part of the plant used in medicine is the leaf which is acid by virtue of the potassium oxalate which it contains. The decoction is used internally as an antipyretic in fevers and in dysentery. Mistaking the properties of the plant it is given for vesical calculus which, if composed of oxalates, would be increased instead of diminished by the treatment. In fact the salt of sorrel in the leaves contains a large quantity of oxalic acid mixed with potassium oxalate. In China, India and the Philippines the entire plant is used as an antiscorbutic.
</p><p>The cold infusion of the leaves is given internally in doses of from 30 to 60 grams, but it is not a medicine to be given indiscriminately, because in addition to its power of adding to the bulk of calculi of the oxalates, the contained potassium oxalate is poisonous in doses of 25 to 30 grams. If a concentrated solution is taken, it operates as a corrosive poison, producing violent pains in the stomach, vomiting, faintness and great weakness. If the solution is dilute its absorption is rapid and it operates very energetically. When a patient is poisoned by a concentrated solution, the stomach-pump is contraindicated, because the mucous membrane of the organ is corroded and ulcerated; if by a dilute solution, use the pump to remove as much of the poison as possible. The best antidote is a watery solution of a soluble salt of lime, <hi>i. e.</hi>, the saccharate, which forms an insoluble salt with oxalic acid.
</p><p>The juice of the leaves is an antidote for the <hi>Datura</hi> (Stramonium). In India they make a decoction of the plant, mix <pb id="pb59" n="59"/>it with onion juice and apply it to the head as a fomentation in hemicrania.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The common name of this tree, whose fruit is so common, causes it to be confused with the name which Linn&#230;us gives to the former species. Balimbin is a fruit of an acid taste, agreeable when ripe, serving the same uses for food as the camia. Its acidity is due to the presence of oxalic acid, which makes the green fruit useful for removing ink and rust stains from clothes. The juice of the fruit is refreshing and is given internally mixed with water and sugar as a refreshing drink in <pb id="pb61" n="61"/>fevers and as an antiscorbutic. For the latter the ripe fruit is eaten uncooked.
</p><p>In Mauritius the juice is used to treat dysentery and hepatitis. Padre Blanco says that the natives use a decoction of camias and unthreshed rice in diarrh&#339;a and bilious colic. In connection with the subject of camias and balimbins we should mention the fruit treatment of the bilious diarrh&#339;a of the tropics, spoken of by the French physicians of Cochin China. Dr. Van der Burg of the Dutch Indies also strongly recommends the treatment of diarrh&#339;a by fruits; in temperate regions using fruits like peaches, pears, etc., and in the tropics, lychies, mangosteens, etc. In regard to the mangosteens we must not forget that, while the bark is given because of the amount of tannin it contains, the composition of the pulp is very different. The fruit acids seem to exercise great influence in the cure of this obstinate disease and I do not hesitate to recommend for this purpose the camia and the ripe balimbin.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Nom. Vulg</hi>.&#8212;<hi>Rudu</hi>, Sp.; <hi>Rue</hi>, Eng.
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The rue of the European, American and Indian pharmacop&#339;ias is emmenagogue, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, excitant, diaphoretic, antiseptic and abortive. It contains an essential oil, and rutinic acid (C<hi rend="sub">25</hi>H<hi rend="sub">28</hi>O<hi rend="sub">15</hi>, Borntrager), starch, gum, etc. The essential oil is greenish-yellow, thick, acrid and <pb id="pb62" n="62"/>bitter; specific gravity 0.911. It boils at 228&#176;, is slightly soluble in water, and soluble in absolute alcohol. It is promptly oxidized by nitric acid, and is converted into pelargonic acid and other fatty acids.
</p><p>Rutin (or rutinic acid), according to Weiss, is a glucoside which exists in the form of fine needles, bright yellow in color. It is slightly soluble in cold water and more so in boiling water. It melts at 190&#176;, and solidifies at freezing point, forming a resinous mass. Its physiological properties are as yet unknown. The part of the plant employed is the leaves, which owe their property, apparently, to the essential oil they contain, from which they also derive their strong and disagreeable odor and their bitter, acrid and nauseous taste.
</p><p>It is used principally as a uterine stimulant or emmenagogue, for which purpose it is given in doses of 0.10&#8211;0.15 centigrams of the freshly powdered leaf and 0.05&#8211;0.10 centigrams of the fresh leaves infused in a liter of water. The dry powder of the leaf should not be used because the essential oil volatilizes and a large proportion of it is lost, which is the most active principle of the drug. It is an agent which should be prescribed with the greatest prudence for large doses are poisonous even to the point of causing death. The symptoms following such doses are colic, vomiting, bloody diarrh&#339;a and tenesmus.
</p><p>It is also used as an antihemorrhagic after childbirth, but its action is slow, not being felt for several hours after the administration of the drug; for this reason it cannot take the place of ergot, though it seems to be superior to the latter in passive hemorrhages. The essential oil is given internally in doses of 2&#8211;6 drops on a piece of sugar. It is sometimes used as an antispasmodic in hysteria, epilepsy and chorea.
</p><p>The Chinese make extensive use of this drug and it is one of their principal abortives. In Hindostan the dried leaves are burnt and the smoke inhaled as a cure for catarrh in children. They are careful not to administer it to pregnant women.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The essence (essential oil) and juice of the fruit are the parts of the plant used in therapeutics. The essence extracted from the rind is yellow, fragrant, slightly bitter; density, 0.856; boiling point 165&#176;. The juice which is turbid and pale yellow in color contains 9% citric acid, 3&#8211;5% gum and sugar and 2&#8203;8&#8260;10&#8203;% inorganic salts. The essence is used to flavor certain pharmaceutical preparations, and is a diffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of 3&#8211;6 drops on a little sugar. The bitter rind is occasionally used in infusion as a stomachic and stimulant. The juice is most commonly used in lemonade, a cooling drink which, used intemperately in the Philippines, is apt to cause gastro-intestinal trouble, so commonly attributed to &#8220;irritation,&#8221; but really the result of a general atony of the digestive organs. Lemon juice is also used with very good results as a local cleansing application for sore throat, as well as externally on fetid ulcers. In some forms of malarial fever it seems to have given satisfactory results, administered internally.
</p><p>In many navies lemon juice forms a part of the sea ration as a preventive of scurvy, upon which it exercises a real and noteworthy action. The Danish navy adopted it for this purpose in 1770, the English navy followed, then the French and possibly others. The English call it lime-juice, and its preventive <pb id="pb66" n="66"/>dose is 30&#8211;40 grams a day. Its curative dose is 100&#8211;150 grams a day. To preserve the lime-juice it was bottled with a layer of oil, which, floating on the surface kept it from contact with the air; but this process gave it a bad taste as did also the addition of sulphate of calcium, and at present the English add, to each liter of juice, 60 grams of alcohol, which preserves it perfectly. Fonssagrives says that the antiscorbutic action of lemon juice is due rather to the vegetable juice itself than to the citric acid which it contains.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;We do not know the medicinal use of this plant in the Philippines. Probably it has none, but we may give those of the species. <hi>R. marmelos</hi>, Cor., the fruit of which is almost identical with that of our species and is called <hi>Bela</hi> or <hi>Bael</hi> in India. The fruit of the Malakabuyaw is ovoid and full of a mucilaginous pulp, aromatic and acid, the same as that of the Bael. The uses of the latter are the following: The pulp acts as an astringent, but it would be more correctly called a tonic of the intestinal mucosa, for it has been experimentally proved that, although it checks diarrh&#339;a, it also acts as a laxative in <pb id="pb68" n="68"/>chronic constipation. In both conditions it seems to operate by toning and regulating the functions of the intestine.
</p><p>Martin, an English physician, was the first to call attention to the properties of Bael, and according to Dr. Green one dose of the pulp of the ripe fruit, prepared with sugar and given every morning, is an efficient remedy in the treatment of the dyspepsia of Europeans in India, especially in the form characterized by constipation and flatulence. The green fruit is a powerful astringent used by the Hindoos for diarrh&#339;a. In cholera epidemics Dr. Bose advises the daily use of an ice made from the pulp of the ripe fruit, the object being the regulation of the functions of the intestine.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The pulp of the ripe fruit has an agreeable odor and is edible. In India the green fruit is used as an astringent in diarrh&#339;a and dysentery; the ripe fruit is given in diseases of the gums and as a gargle. Mir Muhammad Husain states that the ripe fruit is a refrigerant, astringent, cardiac and general tonic, and is very efficacious in the treatment of salivation and ulcers of the throat, strengthening the gums and operating as <pb id="pb70" n="70"/>an astringent. A sorbet made of the ripe fruit whets the appetite and the pulp is used locally for bites of venomous animals. In the latter case the pulverized bark may be used if the fruit cannot be obtained.
</p><p>The fruit of Ferona is a substitute for Bael (<hi>&#198;gle Marmelos</hi>), and is used as such by the English physicians in the hospitals of India. The tender leaves have an agreeable aroma similar to that of anise and are used internally in decoction as a stomachic and carminative.
</p><p>The incised trunk exudes a gum which is used in India as a substitute for gum arabic and there is an active trade in this gum in the bazars of Bombay and Calcutta. According to Pereira, it was at one time imported into England from the east of India under the name of gum arabic. It exists in the form of irregular, semitransparent pieces, of a brownish-red color. With water it forms a mucilage as adhesive as gum arabic, and this solution reddens litmus paper. It is dextrogyrous and is precipitated by the neutral acetate of lead and by caustic baryta.

</p><p>Vrij has extracted from the seeds a 33% oil of a bright yellow color, composed, according to Oudermans, of 84 parts olein to 16 of palmitin and stearin.
</p><p>The bitter principle contained in the root, wood and bark was discovered by Blunse who named it <hi>samaderin</hi>; it is a white, crystalline, foliaceous substance, more soluble in water than in alcohol, fusible. Nitric and hydrochloric acids color it yellow. Sulphuric acid immediately forms a violet red color which disappears as iridescent, feathery crystals are precipitated. (D. Beaumentz et Egasse.)
</p><p>The Filipino &#8220;herb-doctors&#8221; concoct an oil of manungal that in reality contains none of the ingredients of the seeds; it is simply cocoanut oil in which chips of the wood have been soaked. They use it in doses of 30&#8211;60 grams as a purgative, externally as an application to the abdomen in colic or indigestion and with friction in rheumatism or contusions. In India the oil extracted from the seeds is used locally with friction in rheumatism.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The ripe pili nut is edible and sold in confectioneries. It yields a fixed oil, an excellent sample of which was sent by the Manila pharmacist D. A. del Rosario to the Paris Exposition of 1889. &#8220;It is an oil very similar to oil of almond and owing to its physical properties may be used as a substitute for the latter for all the requirements of pharmacy. The only inconvenience connected with its use is the slight one that it solidifies at 3&#176; C. It could furthermore be very advantageously used in the manufacture of fine grades of soap.&#8221; (D. A. del Rosario.)
</p><p>The incised trunk exudes a gum-resin called <hi>brea blanca</hi> (white pitch) in the Philippines and <hi>elemi</hi> in Europe. Until recently it was not known in Europe what tree yielded the gum elemi, some authors stating that according to Blanco it was the resin of the <hi>Icica abilo</hi>, Blanco (<hi>Garuga floribunda</hi>, Decsne); it is not true, however, that Padre Blanco ever attributed such origin to that product or named his Icica the &#8220;pitch-tree.&#8221; On the contrary in speaking of the Canarium, Blanco states that it yields a resin called &#8220;pili-pitch.&#8221; I do not know the <pb id="pb74" n="74"/>reason for this confusion of terms, but presume it to be due to imperfect knowledge of Spanish on the part of those who thus quote Blanco.
</p><p>Pili-pitch, or elemi, as they call it in Manila, is a substance existing in soft masses, slightly yellowish or gray, resembling old honey in appearance. Its odor is strong and agreeable, somewhat like that of lemon and turpentine. Its taste is acrid and bitter.
</p><p>The French pharmacist Meaujean demonstrated in 1820 that elemi contains two resins, one soluble in the cold, and the other in hot spirits of wine. Other chemists, among them Baup, Fl&#252;ckiger and Hanbury, have found elemi to be composed of a resinous substance and a colorless essential oil; the proportion of the latter Fl&#252;ckiger gives as 10% and further states that it is dextrogyrous. Sainte-Claire Deville found the essential oil levogyrous, a fact that emphasizes the probability of there being different products in the market bearing the name of elemi.
</p><p>Baup obtained several principles from it: (1) A resin, <hi>brein</hi>, fusible at 187&#176;, soluble in cold alcohol, crystallizable in oblique rhombic prisms; (2) another crystalline substance, <hi>bryoidin</hi>, soluble in 360 parts water at 10&#176;, and melting at 13&#176;; (3) a small amount of <hi>breidin</hi>, a body soluble in 260 parts water and melting at 100&#176;+; (4) another resin soluble in boiling alcohol, called <hi>amyrin</hi>.
</p><p>White pitch is used in the Philippines to make plasters which they apply to the back and breast of patients suffering from bronchial or pulmonary complaints; it is also applied to indolent ulcers. We believe that elemi possesses the same properties as copaiba, and that its indications for internal use are the same.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The dried and pulverized kernel of the seed is used as an anthelmintic in doses of 1&#189;&#8211;2 grams both in India and Brazil. The same preparation is used in the Philippines in the treatment of dysentery and diarrh&#339;a and its effect is doubtless due to the large quantity of tannin it contains. It is administered as follows: The pounded kernels of 20&#8211;25 seeds are <pb id="pb83" n="83"/>brought to a boil in 2 bottles (sic) of water. When the liquid has evaporated a third, it is removed from the fire, cooled, decanted, and again placed on the fire after adding three to four hundred grams of sugar. This time it is allowed to boil till reduced to one bottle. The dose is 50&#8211;60 grams 2&#8211;3 times a day. Incisions in the trunk exude a brownish resin which solidifies in the air, is slightly acrid, bitter, dissolves in alcohol and partially in water. In Malabar it is given internally in the treatment of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, mixing it with white of egg and opium. But the curative value of the combination is more likely due to the albumen and opium than to the resin. Dissolved in lemon juice it is a useful application in the itch. The trunk bark is astringent and is employed in decoction as a wash for ulcers and eczema and as an injection in leucorrh&#339;a.
</p><p>The fruit is one of the most highly prized in the Philippines, and resident Europeans are able to eat large quantities of it without ill effects unless the fruit is over-ripe, in which case it often causes transient diarrh&#339;a, which should be treated with a mild purge.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The pericarp of the nut contains an essential oil which is very irritant and used by the Hindoos as a vesicant; it severely blisters the lips and tongues of imprudent persons who break the nut without taking the precaution of cleansing it of the oil before opening it. In addition to the oil called <hi>cardol</hi>, the pericarp contains an especial acid <hi>anacardic</hi>, a little tannin and ammonia. Cardol (C<hi rend="sub">21</hi>H<hi rend="sub">31</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is an oleaginous, yellow liquid very unstable, neutral, soluble in alcohol and ether, insoluble in water, volatile, and vesicant if applied to the skin. &#8220;Anacardic&#8221; acid is white, crystalline, odorless, with a burning, aromatic taste. It melts at 26&#176; and decomposes at 200&#176; <pb id="pb85" n="85"/>forming a colorless oil; it is not vesicant, burns with a dark flame, and has the odor of rancid oil. A tincture of the pericarp has been made (1 part to 10 of alcohol) and given internally as a vermifuge in doses of 2&#8211;10 drops. Cardol, according to some authors, does not exercise a vesicant action in the gastro-intestinal canal, because it is not dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices; I am sure, however, that I have seen a choleraic diarrh&#339;a brought on by swallowing, in fun, the pericarp of one nut and a half. Cardol is eliminated by the urine.
</p><p>The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste when roasted. By expression it yields a sweet, yellowish oil, density 0.916.
</p><p>The trunk exudes a gum resin in masses varying in color from red to yellow.
</p><p>The fleshy part, called the fruit, is edible but contains a certain quantity of cardol not only evidenced by the odor but by the smarting of the mouth and throat after eating. It is very juicy and the expressed liquid is fermented in Bombay and distilled to make a very weak alcohol which sells for the very low price of 4 annas (5 cents gold) a gallon. This alcohol is again distilled and a stronger obtained which sells for 1&#189; rupees a gallon. The Portuguese of India make a sort of wine from the fermented juice of the fruit, which, like the weak alcohol we have mentioned, is a well-known diuretic and is used as a liniment.
</p><p>The gum resin of the trunk contains 90% of anacardic acid and 10% cardol. Wood soaked in it is preserved from the ravages of insects, especially of white ants, for which purpose it is used by bookbinders also. Therapeutically it is used externally in leprosy, old ulcers and to destroy corns, but on account of its rubefacient and vesicant qualities it is necessary to use it cautiously.

<pb id="pb89" n="89"/></p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The part of the plant most important in therapeutics is the seed, the size of a small pea, bright red with a black spot, hard and shining. The Filipino children use them to make rosaries and other decorations. In the distant past the Filipinos used these seeds to weigh gold, a practice followed even to-day by the Hindoos. The famous Susrutas, author of the &#8220;Ayur Veda,&#8221; recommends them internally for nervous diseases; modern therapeutics, however, limits their use to one disease, though that is frequent and stubborn enough, namely chronic granular conjunctivitis.
</p><p>Some physicians state that these seeds are poisonous and others the contrary, but the fact that they are used as food among the poor classes of Egypt, demonstrates their harmlessness in the digestive tract at least; when introduced into the circulation they undoubtedly exercise a toxic effect. We have already mentioned that their use is limited nowadays to the therapeutics of the eye; the decoction of the seeds known in Europe under the name of &#8220;Jaqueriti&#8221;&#8212;so named in Brazil&#8212;produces a purulent inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva and it is precisely this counter-irritant effect which makes it useful in chronic granular conjunctivitis, the persistence of which has defied the most heroic measures of therapeutics. The French oculist, Dr. de Wecker, was the first to employ jequirity for this purpose, in the form of a 24 hours&#8217; maceration of the seeds, 10 grams to 500 grams of water. It is necessary to use a product recently prepared and with this several applications a day are made. It is now known that the inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva is not caused by germ-life contained in the solution but by an inorganic ferment discovered by Bruylans and Venneman and named jequiritin; they state that it is produced during the germination of the seeds or of the cells in the powdered seeds. Warden and Waddell, of Calcutta, have isolated an essential oil, an acid named &#8220;&#225;bric&#8221; and an amorphous substance called abrin, obtained by <pb id="pb90" n="90"/>precipitation with alcohol from a watery infusion of the pulverized seeds. Its action is identical with that of &#8220;jequiritin.&#8221;
</p><p>The infusion appears to possess considerable value as a stimulating application to indolent ulcers.
</p><p>The root is a good substitute for licorice, is emollient and has an agreeable taste. The extract is useful in catarrhal diseases of the bronchi and in dysuria. The leaves contain the same properties as the root and an extract prepared from them is used as a substitute for licorice.

The alcoholic extract of the root, a soft, brown, resinous substance with an odor recalling that of jalap, is a very active cathartic, producing sharp effects in doses of 30&#8211;60 centigrams; in fact it produces such severe tenesmus that its use in such doses should not be recommended.

In decoction it is used as a gargle for sore throat. The second is also an excellent building material and is used medicinally for its astringent properties. A decoction of sufficient strength to color the water a light blue is used as a mouth wash in toothache and has some reputation as a solvent of vesical calculi. All three species yield a resin known in pharmacy under the name of &#8220;kino.&#8221; The true gum kino is really <pb id="pb94" n="94"/>produced by the <hi>P. marsupium</hi>, Roxb., but the Philippine product, especially that of the second and third species, has for a long time been exported to Europe under the name of &#8220;red astringent gum&#8221; or &#8220;kino.&#8221; This name is given to the sap of these trees dried without the aid of artificial heat. The bark is the part which produces it and the following extractive process is employed in Madras: a vertical incision is made in the trunk and lateral incisions perpendicular to it and a receptacle is placed at the foot of the tree. This soon fills and when the gum is sufficiently dried by air and sun it is packed in boxes and exported.
</p><p>In respect to appearance, solubility and chemical composition, Fl&#252;ckiger and Hanbury were unable to discover any difference between the kino of <hi>P. marsupium</hi>, Roxb., and that of <hi>P. erinaceus</hi>, Poir.

</p><p>Kino is at present used but little in therapeutics and its action is analogous to that of tannin and catechu. It is given internally for its astringent effect in chronic diarrh&#339;a, leucorrh&#339;a, blenorrh&#339;a and hemorrhages. The dose of the powder is 1&#8211;4 grams, and of the alcoholic tincture, containing 20 parts kino to 100 of alcohol, 5&#8211;10 grams.

</p><p>In the Philippines the powdered seed is given in affections of the digestive tract, especially in diarrh&#339;a and feeble digestion. The same name of Bonduc is given to the seeds of another species that grows in the Philippines, <hi>C. Bonduc</hi>, Roxb.; <hi>Kamot-Kabag</hi>, <hi>Bayan-Kambig&#771;</hi>, Tag. The seeds are identical in chemical composition and therapeutic indication.
</p><p>The two principal substances contained in the seeds are an oil, 24% and a resin, 1.88%. The former is straw-colored and slightly bitter by virtue of the presence of a resin that may be precipitated by alcohol. The resin or bitter principle exists as an amorphous powder, white, bitter, not acrid, soluble in chloroform, alcohol, acetone, crystallizable acetic acid, fixed and essential oils; slightly soluble in ether and bisulphide of carbon, insoluble in water and petroleum ether. The alkalies do not affect it. It melts at 140&#176;, decomposing and leaving only a carbon.

Hydrochloric acid colors it red; sulphuric acid, a maranthin red in half an hour.
</p><p>Bonducin seems to be the active principle of the seeds and is given internally in doses of 10&#8211;20 centigrams; according to Dr. Isnard, of Marseilles, this dose has given as good results in fevers as the same quantity of quinine.

The patient takes this decoction hot the first day of the fever and a profuse perspiration promptly breaks out. As a rule the effect is immediate and the fever does not recur. This treatment of fevers is more common in that country than that by quinine and they claim that it has the advantage over the latter of acting as a stomachic tonic. By adding a small quantity of the roots to the decoction it is rendered diuretic. The seeds possess the same properties and are used in decoctions of 30 grams to 300 of water.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;This is one of the most popular Philippine remedies and its usefulness is vouched for by many physicians practicing in many different lands. Its antiherpetic properties are notable <pb id="pb103" n="103"/>and the Tagalo name of the plant, &#8220;Gamut sa Buni,&#8221; means literally &#8220;medicine for herpes.&#8221; The natives use the juice of the leaf applied locally to the affected part. These properties have long been familiar to the Malays and to the Hindoos who in their medical works give the plant the Sanscrit name of &#8220;Dadrughna,&#8221; meaning &#8220;to cure herpes.&#8221; The Pharmacop&#339;ia of Bengal recommends cassia in the form of an ointment made by mixing the crushed tender leaves with simple ointment. This preparation is, in our opinion, undesirable on account of its liability to become rancid and vaseline should be the excipient used. Another application for herpetic eruptions is the juice of the leaves mixed with an equal quantity of lemon juice. The Malays use the leaves dried in the sun, adding to them a little water and rubbing them briskly on the affected parts, the vigorous treatment being an important part of the cure.
</p><p>The decoction of the leaves is a laxative and according to Mr. J. Wood the tincture has an action similar to that of senna. Dr. Pulney Andy of India states that the extract prepared from the tender leaves is a good substitute for extract of colocynth.
</p><p>Mr. A. Porte claims to have obtained the best results with an acetic extract of the fresh leaves. The following is his formula:

<table id="t31" rend="width(60%)"><column/><column rend="align(right)"/><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">Fresh leaves of <hi>C. alata</hi>              </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1">100 grams.</cell></row><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">Acetic acid diluted in &#8532; water        </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1">450 <ditto>grams.</ditto></cell></row></table>
</p><p>Macerate 10 or 12 days, filter and express, then filter again and evaporate to the consistency of an extract.
</p><p>The seeds contain vermifuge principles.
</p><p>The activity of this plant in herpes is due to the chrysophanic acid contained in it. The more recent the eruption the more certain is the effect.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The use made of the mashed bark of this tree is well known throughout the Philippines. Cut in strips and beaten thoroughly between stones it is sold under the name of &#8220;gogo&#8221;; it is macerated in water, to which it imparts a reddish color, and forms a substitute for soap. The Filipinos use this preparation for bathing, especially the hair, for which purpose there is no more useful or simple preparation. It cures pityriasis, and renders the hair very soft, without drying it too much as is usually the case with soap. The natives use it in treating the itch, washing the affected parts with the maceration and at the same time briskly rubbing them with the bark; in this way <pb id="pb107" n="107"/>they remove the crusts that shield the acari. The treatment is successful in direct proportion to the energy of rubbing.
</p><p>The seeds of &#8220;gogo&#8221; are very large, lenticular, flattened, 3&#8211;4 centimeters in diameter. Their chemical composition has been studied by Pettit. Alcohol dissolves the active principle, perhaps a glucoside, the study of which the author has not completed. Five centigrams of this substance administered to a guinea-pig causes paralysis of the hind quarters without any apparent inflammation. He also found saponin in the seeds, but it exists in much greater quantity in the trunk. In the Sunda Islands they eat the seeds roasted and also extract from them an illuminating oil.
</p><p>The maceration of gogo is emetic and purgative; it is used in the treatment of asthma; it is exceedingly irritating, the slightest quantity that enters the eye causing severe smarting and a slight conjunctivitis for one or two days.

Dr. Waring has experimented with them and recommends them highly. The taste may be made more agreeable by adding a little cinnamon to the decoction. Dymock states that three fruits are sufficient, and Dr. Hove gives one as the effective dose. This lack of agreement may be explained by the fact that the fruits are of different sizes, and probably Waring refers to those of medium size. Contrary to what one would imagine, judging from its purgative action, the fruit contains astringent principles, and makes an effective injection for leucorrh&#339;a as a substitute for nut galls. It is also of some merit in the treatment of piles.
</p><p>The green fruit is highly esteemed by Radja Kalikesen as a carminative, tonic and purgative.

Scott has maintained that by adding the powdered seed to a mixture of malt and starch, fermentation is impeded; but Dr. Villy in the laboratory of Dujardin-Beaumetz has demonstrated that such is not the case. Contrary to the opinions of those physicians who stated that &#8220;jambul&#8221; was capable of causing the glucose to disappear from the urine of diabetic patients without concurrent diabetic regimen, Dujardin-Beaumetz observed in his trials of the drug that the slightest relaxation of the regimen was followed by an increase of glucose. Under the influence of the medicine in doses of 2&#8211;10 grams daily, at the same time maintaining a strict diabetic diet, the Parisian therapeutist noted that the glucose disappears from the third to the fifth day; but this occurred only in cases of medium intensity, whereas in severe cases the medication produced no effect. Upon stopping the treatment the sugar reappeared.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The leaves contain an irritant and acrid principle that renders them vesicant when applied to the skin. The Pharmacop&#339;ia of India quotes Sir W. O&#8217;Shaughnessy to the effect that plasters made of the bruised leaves even when renewed every half hour require 24 hours to raise a blister and at the same time cause severe pain. He found it much more painful than cantharides and much less prompt to act. Dr. Dymock has prepared an ethereal tincture of the leaves and obtained with it results very different from those just mentioned; this is not surprising in view of the fact that the tincture holds in solution in a small quantity of ether, a considerable amount of the vesicant principle. This tincture has the same color as the &#8220;epispastic&#8221; of the English Pharmacop&#339;ia, causes less pain and rapidly raises a good blister, facts of which I have convinced myself by the use of a small quantity sent me from Bombay in 1891.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;This is a very popular plant in the Orient, for many races use its leaves to impart a reddish-yellow stain to the nails, finger tips and palms of the hands. There is a tradition among the Mohammedans that the Prophet once called this plant &#8220;the best of all herbs.&#8221; The leaf in form of a dry powder is sold in the bazars of India under the name of &#8220;henna&#8221;; mixed <pb id="pb119" n="119"/>with water it gives it a yellow color, and when boiled the tone of the liquid becomes darker; the addition of an alkali turns it brown. In Persia they add indigo to this solution and use it as a hair dye.
</p><p>The Hindoos apply the bruised leaves to the soles of the feet of small-pox patients, their purpose being to prevent the spread of the eruption to the eyes. They also use it locally in a disease known among them as &#8220;burning of the feet.&#8221; Grierson and Waring obtained good results in this disease by making a paste of the bruised leaves and vinegar; cases that resisted such treatment yielded completely to a brisk rubbing of the feet with a simple paste of the leaf. The decoction and the bruised leaves are also used locally for contusions.

It should not be given when rectal tenesmus exists. The Pharmacop&#339;ia of India contains the following formula for preparing the decoction of the peel:

</p><p>Boil for 15 minutes in a covered vessel, cool, filter and add water enough to make a liter. Dose, 30&#8211;50 grams per diem.
</p><p>This preparation is also used in astringent gargles and injections. For internal use the decoction is rendered more active by adding a small quantity of cloves or cinnamon. This mixture with the addition of opium gives excellent results in the treatment of diarrh&#339;a among the natives of India and is highly recommended by Dr. Kirkpatrick.
</p><p>The most important part of the pomegranate, however, is its root, the bark of which is a very efficient t&#230;nifuge and the most astringent portion of the plant. It should be used fresh, as drying destroys its activity and gives negative results. Many failures to expel the t&#230;nia are probably due to this fact. According to B&#233;ranger-F&#233;raud the root gives 25% to 40% of cures, whereas pumpkin seeds give but 5% to 10%.

</p><p>Macerate 6 hours, boil over slow fire till reduced to 500 grams. Strain. Administer fasting, in 3 doses half an hour apart. The evening before the patient should eat a light meal and take a cathartic in order that the intestinal canal may contain the smallest possible quantity of f&#230;cal matter. After taking the third dose of the decoction the patient should take a mild purgative such as 30 grams of castor oil to expel the t&#230;nia. This preparation has a most disagreeable taste. It is better to give the &#8220;tannate of pelletierine,&#8221; a compound of tannin and one of the alkaloids that Tanret discovered in pomegranate root. A sufficient dose of tannate of pelletierine is 30&#8211;40 centigrams in wafer form, followed by a purge and with the other precautions and preparatory measures mentioned above. It causes toxic symptoms similar to those produced by curare, according to the experimental studies of Dujardin-Beaumetz and Rocheni&#232;re. Its action is upon the ends of the motor nerves. A dose of 40 centigrams may cause in man such symptoms of intoxication as vertigo, inverted vision and muscular paralysis. Pelletierine should not be administered to children, but B&#233;ranger-F&#233;raud states that the tannate may be safely given them, as follows:

<table id="t40" rend="width(60%)"><column/><column rend="align(right)"/><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">Tannate of pelletierine           </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1"> 0.30 grams.</cell></row><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">Sweetened water                   </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1">40.00 <ditto>grams.</ditto></cell></row></table>
</p><p>A coffee-spoonful of this solution contains 0.03 gram of the tannate, and this quantity may be given to a child, in a little milk. If no symptoms supervene within one-half hour give another similar dose and so on up to 3 or 4 doses or .12 gm. in all. After the last dose give the purgative as a routine. It is certainly imprudent to trust the administration of such a drug to any one incapable of recognizing the symptoms of intoxication, and as no one but a physician can judge the effects of the alkaloid he himself should remain with the patient until the <pb id="pb122" n="122"/>efficient dose has been absorbed. This is manifestly impractical and we therefore maintain that the alkaloid is not suited for the treatment of children.
</p><p>An analysis of the root bark made by the French chemist Tanret revealed the presence of four alkaloids: pelletierine, isopelletierine (C<hi rend="sub">8</hi>H<hi rend="sub">15</hi>NO), pseudo-pelletierine (C<hi rend="sub">9</hi>H<hi rend="sub"><corr sic="16">15</corr></hi>NO), and methylpeletierine (C<hi rend="sub">9</hi>H<hi rend="sub">17</hi>NO).

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The decoction of the leaves is used locally in sores and atonic ulcers, followed by a poultice of the boiled and mashed leaves. The natives use the cold infusion of the leaves to wash clothes spotted with blood and the spots disappear rapidly by virtue of the ferment papain which digests the fibrin. The infusion is also very useful as a wash for sores and gangrenous ulcers, modifying their appearance very rapidly.
</p><p>Before proceeding further it is desirable to give a description of papain, a digestive ferment which exists throughout the whole plant, fruit, trunk, leaves and petioles; it is contained in the milky juice which exudes from all these parts when cut. This juice was studied simultaneously by Wurtz in France and Peckolt in Brazil. The best method of collecting it is to make several superficial, longitudinal incisions in the green fruit without removing it from the tree; immediately an abundance of juice appears in the incisions and coagulates rapidly. The best time to do this is the early morning. The fruit does not suffer by this process but continues developing and ripens perhaps more rapidly, at the same time improving in flavor, becoming sweeter; the seeds, however, atrophy and lose their power of germination. Peckolt gives the following as the composition of the juice:

</p><p>The milky juice is neutral and coagulates rapidly, separating in two parts: a kind of insoluble pulp and a limpid colorless serum. If combined with fibrin, raw meat, white of egg or gluten it gradually softens them and completely dissolves them in 3 or 4 hours <hi>in vitro</hi> at 40&#176; C. Combined with milk it coagulates it and soon precipitates the casein which is also dissolved a little later. It digests lumbricoids and tape-worms and the false membrane of croup, in a few hours. According to Wurtz and Bouchut papain is prepared as follows:
</p><p>The fluid juice or the aqueous solution of the milky exudate is precipitated by the addition of ten times the volume of alcohol. The precipitate, after treating again with concentrated alcohol, is dissolved in water and the addition of sub-acetate of lead eliminates the albuminoids and peptones but does not precipitate the papain. The liquid is filtered and the lead salts separated by means of a current of hydrogen sulphide. It is filtered again and alcohol added gradually, which process first precipitates whatever sulphate of lead may have passed through the filter, and then the papain.
</p><p>Papain is an amorphous substance, perfectly white, soluble in water, insipid, odorless. An aqueous solution, if shaken violently, foams like a solution of soap. Boiling makes it turbid and when concentrated it has a slightly astringent taste. It is precipitated by hydrochloric, nitric, picric and the metaphosphoric acids. Trommer&#8217;s test gives it a beautiful blue violet color which, on boiling, changes to a red violet.
<pb id="pb125" n="125"/></p><p>It is an extremely active digestive ferment, comparable with pepsin, but superior to the latter because it does not require an acid medium, as its digestive action takes place even in the presence of an alkaline medium and of antiseptic substances such as boric acid, phenol, etc. It is given in doses of 10&#8211;40 centigrams in different vehicles such as water, wine, etc. It should be given after meals carefully and properly diluted, in order that its action may not be exerted upon the gastric mucous membrane itself. Its use is contraindicated in gastric ulcer.
</p><p>A watery solution prepared by macerating the green fruit has been used effectively to remove blemishes from the face, leaving the skin clean and smooth. The natives use little pieces of the green fruit to remove freckles (which they call <hi>pecas</hi>). The ripe fruit is edible and its taste quite agreeable; in some of the Malay Islands it is given for dysentery, but it must be remembered that the ripe fruit does not contain papain.
</p><p>The pure exudate is given to children as an anthelmintic in doses of 2&#8211;6 grams with a little molasses, but it is not so harmless that it may be used with impunity in this form, Moncorvo and others having reported cases of peritonitis with symptoms suggestive of cholera following its use. It is drastic and digestive in addition to its anthelmintic action, but according to Rabuteau, boiling destroys the first property without affecting the others. Dr. Lemarchand of the island of Mauritius gives the following anthelmintic prescription:

</p><p>The triturated seeds may be given internally in doses of 1&#8211;2 grams with milk or molasses to expel lumbricoids. Analysis has revealed in the seeds the presence of a resinous oil, an oleaginous material of disagreeable odor and taste called by Peckolt <hi>caricin</hi>, a fatty acid, papayic acid and a resin. In India the seeds are considered emmenagogue. In some countries they wrap meat in papaya leaves for several hours before eating in order to soften it. For the same purpose they sometimes boil the meat in water containing a few leaves or pieces of the green fruit; some even go to the length of saying that it is only necessary to hang a piece of meat in a papaya tree for a time in order to soften it.
</p><p>The decoction of the green fruit is given internally for indigestion, a treatment common in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga. The milky juice is used to remove corns and Dr. Daruty offers the following prescription for eczema and psoriasis:

</p><p>The second species, <hi>T. cucumerina</hi>, has a wider use. In India it is regarded as a febrifuge and laxative and is commonly given with some aromatic. Ainslie notes that the leaves, as well as the fruit, are bitter and purgative and that the Tamuls use them for their laxative and stomachic effect. Drury states that on the Malabar coast the seeds have a considerable reputation as a remedy for functional disorders of the stomach. Although the green fruit is very bitter the natives of that region use it as a condiment. The tender stems and the dry capsules, both bitter and purgative, are given in infusion and in a sweetened solution, as an aid to digestion. The seeds are febrifuge and anthelmintic.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The three above-mentioned varieties of <hi>L. vulgaris</hi>, Ser., are commonly grouped under the name calabaza (gourd). All have the same action and hence the same therapeutic application. The green portion of the rind is bitter and possesses purgative and emetic properties. The decoction of the tender shoots is expectorant; in addition it appears to possess purgative properties and in India is used in jaundice.
</p><p>The part of the plant most generally used is the seeds, the t&#230;nifuge properties of which are well known. Its action, however, is not always certain, which may be as truly said of all other known t&#230;nifuges. The seeds have the advantage of lacking the disgusting taste characteristic of other remedies of the same class; the taste is almost neutral and a little sugar conceals it completely. The dose is unlimited; some take 15 grams, others as high as 100, and no unpleasant symptoms of any kind have been reported. The only precaution to be observed is to give the patient a purgative 1&#8211;2 hours after his dose.
</p><p>Heckel has analyzed the seeds and found a resin which he calls <hi>pepo-resina</hi>; it exists in the greenish pellicle that envelopes the embryo and appears to be the active principle of the seeds. Its dose is 0.80&#8211;1.00 gram (Dujardin-Beaumetz), the product of 250 grams of the seeds. The dose of 100 grams of the seeds mentioned above is very small, if the pepo-resin represents the entire active principle, for 100 grams of the seeds would only contain about 40 centigrams.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The root is a hydragogue cathartic even in minute doses. The fruit is emollient by virtue of the large quantity of mucilage it contains, but it is more interesting for other properties.

It serves the same purpose as a sponge and has the advantages that its fibers do not rot and that they are easily kept clean. In view of its cheapness and plentifulness in the Philippines the above advantages should suffice to bring it into universal use for the toilet, for surgical purposes and for cleaning in general.

</p><p>Dr. Dervegie reports good results in the treatment of eczema, administering the powdered leaf in dozes of 0.10 gram and applying locally the powder or an ointment of the same. The most marked and constant effects of the drug are a considerable increase of the urinary secretion, elevation of the temperature of the skin and profuse diaphoresis.
</p><p>Dr. Boileau, quoted above, himself contracted leprosy of which he died; he experimented on himself with &#8220;hydrocotyle&#8221; and on one occasion a dose of 3 grams nearly proved fatal; tetanic symptoms supervened with suffocation, palpitation, epistaxis and rectal hemorrhage, abating finally with profuse sweating and diuresis.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The bark of this tree has a wide reputation in India as a tonic and febrifuge. The inner layer of the bark possesses astringent and bitter properties much like quinine. Ainslie states that it is used in India to tan hides and therapeutically where an astringent is required. O&#8217;Shaughnessy experimented with it in the hospital of the Medical College of Calcutta and reported good tonic and antipyretic effects.
</p><p>In 1870, according to Dymock, Broughton analyzed the fresh bark and reported that the bitter taste was due to <hi>esculin</hi>, which after drying and coming in contact with decomposing organic matter is transformed into the almost tasteless <hi>esculetin</hi>. Naylor studied the bark at a later period, and attributed the bitterness to an alkaloid that he named <hi>hymenodictyonine</hi>. This substance exists in the form of a gelatinous mass, cream-colored, very hygroscopic. An ethereal solution, carefully evaporated, deposits it in the form of crystals. Its empirical form is C<hi rend="sub">23</hi>H<hi rend="sub">40</hi>N<hi rend="sub">2</hi>; it is probably volatile and is notable for its lack of oxygen. It differs from <hi>quinoidine</hi> in that it is inactive (?) and that in combination with platinum it retains less of this metal than does quinoidine. It differs from <hi>paricine</hi> in its proportion of hydrogen, and from <hi>berberine</hi> in containing more carbon. In the presence of sulphuric acid its solution assumes a yellow color, changing to wine-red and then to dark red. <pb id="pb141" n="141"/>Naylor extracted another principle which he found combined with the alkaloid in a soda precipitate of the latter; it is a product of the decomposition of a glucose, the formula of which is C<hi rend="sub">25</hi>H<hi rend="sub">49</hi>O<hi rend="sub">7</hi>. This compound remains insoluble when the alkaloid is treated with ether. Repeated boiling in alcohol renders it colorless. It is bitter, soluble in alcohol and dilute acids; insoluble in ether and chloroform. Reaction, neutral.

</p><p><hi rend="bold">Coffea Arabica</hi>, L.
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Nom. Vulg.</hi>&#8212;<hi>Cafe</hi>, Sp.; <hi>Coffee</hi>, Eng.
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The infusion of roasted and ground coffee seeds constitutes a beverage of Arabic origin, but now common all over the world. In the Philippines, where a few years ago the coffee plant was only cultivated in gardens, the harvest has assumed such proportions that it now constitutes one of the greatest sources of agricultural wealth. Its use is becoming more general every day and the discovery of its alkaloid &#8220;caffeine&#8221; the therapeutical use of which is also steadily increasing, has given new importance to the seed on account of its increasing demand in the drug trade. When newly harvested its taste is not very agreeable, for it needs considerable time&#8212;2 or 3 years&#8212;in which to dry completely, before it acquires the aromatic properties and the savor of which it is susceptible. General Morin relates an incident of having drunk a delicious infusion of coffee made from authentic Moka that had been kept for fifty years, of course under ideal conditions of preservation.
</p><p>In civilized countries coffee is an article of prime necessity as a food; here we shall consider it therapeutically under two heads, as a tonic-stimulant and as an antiseptic. As caffeine is the principle that acts upon the heart we shall consider the cardiac properties of coffee under the head of that alkaloid, so important that it may best be studied separately.
</p><p>There are two preparations of coffee, the decoction used by the Arabs and the infusion, used in Europe and adopted in the Philippines. The decoction forms a tonic and aromatic drink devoid of any excitant properties, but the infusion is highly excitant and should not be taken in such large amounts as the decoction, for its action may be powerful enough to cause headache, <pb id="pb145" n="145"/>nausea, trembling of the extremities and disorders of vision and hearing. These phenomena however are not dangerous and rapidly subside as soon as the urine eliminates the substances that cause them.
</p><p>Infusion of coffee stimulates especially the cerebral functions and the circulation; as to its digestive properties, opinion is divided but it is more probable that it lacks them and that coffee taken after meals owes its reputation as a digestive aid to two distinct factors&#8212;the temperature and the sugar. Without doubt it exerts an anaphrodisiac action, on account of which the illustrious <corr sic="Linneus">Linn&#230;us</corr> called it the &#8220;drink of eunuchs.&#8221; This action seems incompatible with the fact that the Arabs, who are so much given to the abuse of the pleasures forbidden to eunuchs are most addicted to the use and abuse of coffee. The explanation rests in the form in which they consume their coffee, namely the decoction, which is free from the sedative principle of the seed, that undoubtedly resides in the aromatic ingredient &#8220;cafeol.&#8221;
</p><p>Coffee is contraindicated in hysterical and nervous persons, in children and in those who suffer with insomnia or palpitation. It counteracts sleep and coma, being very useful in poisoning by opium or its alkaloids. Its stimulant action is as rapid as that of alcohol. On several occasions it has yielded me marked results when given by stomach or by enema in cases of nervous and cardiac depression. Indeed it is a remedy that I cannot recommend too highly and each day leaves me more convinced of its therapeutic activity and certainty.
</p><p>Attention has only lately been directed to the antiseptic property of coffee though we have long been availing ourselves of that property without knowing it; this is true of many other medicinal agents, indeed of all that the modern studies of bacteriology have presented to us as antifermentives and microbicides. Roasted coffee in powder form gives good results if dusted over ulcers and gangrenous sores, rapidly improving their appearance <pb id="pb146" n="146"/>and destroying the f&#339;tid odor. It corrects the unhygienic properties of non-potable water and therefore enters into the army and navy ration of nearly all the nations of Europe. In epidemics of disease every physician should advise its use in mild infusion as a regular beverage.
</p><p>Dr. Luderitz, experimenting in the Hygienic Institute of Berlin, reported that no bacteria could resist the action of coffee in infusion. He attributed this action not only to the tannin, which is present in high percentage, but principally to the empyreumatic substances formed by the roasting. The caffeine takes no part in this action. Dr. Luderitz exposed the coffee to the open air for six days and found it free from bacteria at the end of that time. Whatever may be the explanation of its activity the fact remains that coffee is highly antiseptic, and this should be kept in mind by physicians not only because it is everywhere easily obtained and an infusion easily prepared, but because it in addition possesses the great advantage of being nontoxic.

</p><p>Caffeine, the only one of the ingredients that interests us, was discovered by Hunge in 1821 and recognized as an alkaloid <pb id="pb147" n="147"/>by Herzog. It also exists in tea, formerly known as &#8220;theine&#8221; which is now known to be identical with caffeine; both are expressed by the formula C<hi rend="sub">8</hi>H<hi rend="sub">10</hi>N<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>+H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O. It crystallizes in fine, silky needles, is colorless, odorless and slightly bitter.
</p><p>It is considered a substitute for digitalis, especially valuable as a diuretic and where cerebral anemia exists. Germain See values it as a preventive medicine, acting principally upon the heart and thus preventing fatigue; with this end in view he advises its use before long marches, violent exercise and all conditions where the heart will be called upon to do a greatly increased amount of work. Dose 0.25 gram to 1 or 2 grams a day given by stomach or hypodermic injection.
</p><p>Caffeine is also useful in headache, neuralgia, and asthma and as a general tonic. For the latter action it is best given in pill form, 0.02&#8211;0.04 gram a day, with the extract of cinchona or other bitter tonic.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;This shrub is very common in gardens, well known by its pretty yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The trunk bark possesses antiperiodic properties first described by Descourtilz and confirmed later by Dr. G. Bidie and Dr. J. Short. Both the latter used the tincture in 10&#8211;15-drop doses 3 times a <pb id="pb160" n="160"/>day. This tincture was prepared by macerating for one week in 150 grams of alcohol 30 grams of fresh bark finely divided. This preparation operates as an emetic and purgative in doses of 30&#8211;60 drops. It is evident that the plant possesses very active, even poisonous properties and should be employed with great caution. The decoction of the bark is given as an emetic and cathartic, but very imprudently because there is no means of determining the quantity of active principle, shown by chemical analysis to be a dangerous product.
</p><p>The fruit is very bitter and acrid. The seeds yield by expression 35 to 41% oil (De Vry) and 57% when treated with benzol. It has an agreeable odor resembling that of sweet almonds, its density is 0.9148 at 25&#176; and it is perfectly clear and transparent at that temperature. At 15&#176; it thickens and at 13&#176; solidifies. According to Oudemans it consists of 63% triolein and 37% tripalmin and tristearin; it is not poisonous. After expression De Vry obtained from the caked residue 4% of a crystalline glucoside called by him <hi>thevetin</hi>. Blas, of the Academy of Medicine of Belgium, studied it later and described it as a white powder of small colorless scales, odorless, very bitter, soluble at 14&#176; in 122 parts of water, in alcohol, in crystallizable acetic acid, insoluble in ether; formula C<hi rend="sub">54</hi>H<hi rend="sub">34</hi>O<hi rend="sub">24</hi>. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it, producing a dark red color that changes to cherry red and then after several hours to violet. The color disappears if water be added. Boiled in acid solution the glucoside changes to a new substance, <hi>theveresin</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">48</hi>H<hi rend="sub">70</hi>O<hi rend="sub">17</hi>), white, amorphous, slightly soluble in boiling water and in alcohol, insoluble in benzine or chloroform, soluble in alkalies, very bitter. Both substances are energetic narcotic poisons; but the plant contains another even more powerful poison isolated by Warden, of Calcutta; it does not form crystals, it is very bitter, freely soluble in water, and is turned yellow by sulphuric and nitric acids.
</p><p>Thevetin and theveresin exercise a marked toxic effect on the <pb id="pb161" n="161"/>heart. The former induces emetic and cathartic phenomena, trembling and progressive weakness. The latter does not cause vomiting or diarrh&#339;a, but an&#230;sthesia and rigidity of the limbs. Both poisons arrest the heart in systole. Injected hypodermically they are irritant, are eliminated by the liver, but are not found in the urine.

</p><p>The bark of the root and of the trunk is an excellent remedy for blenorrhagia. The fresh bark is thoroughly comminuted and mixed with sweetened water in the proportion of 60 grams to 4 liters; this mixture is put in the sun for 4 days, and shaken from time to time. It is then strained and given in doses of 4&#8211;5 glassfuls a day, at the same time with refreshing and emollient drinks, and prolonged tepid baths. At first this preparation exerts a purgative action, but later acts upon the urinary organs, rapidly lessening the suppurative process in urethritis. The bark may also be associated with wine or beer, in the proportion of 30 grains to the liter, the dose being 2&#8211;4 small cupfuls a day and Dr. Grosourdy employs the extract of the bark in doses aggregating 0.20&#8211;0.25 gram a day, gradually increased till at the end of a week 6 grams are taken daily (Dr. J. Amadeo).

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The trunk bark is a febrifuge of great importance; it is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India and is widely used <pb id="pb164" n="164"/>in the Philippines. Personally I have had occasion to use it in several cases of malarial fever in the town of San Mateo near Manila. It is astringent, anthelmintic and antiperiodic, highly useful in chronic diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, not only for its astringent effects but for its tonic and restorative action. As a tonic it gives as good results as quinine. The dry powdered bark is given internally in wafers of 20&#8211;30 centigrams. The infusion is prepared from 15 grams of the dry comminuted bark to 300 of water. The dose is 30&#8211;60 grams 2 or 3 times a day.
</p><p>Another convenient preparation is the tincture, 75 grams of the powdered bark macerated 7 days in 500 grams of alcohol, shaking from time to time. It is then filtered and enough alcohol added to make up the 500 cc. The dose is 4&#8211;8 grams a day.
</p><p>I have often used the following wine as a tonic for convalescents and patients suffering from general debility: Finely powdered bark, 25 grams, muscatel or dry sherry one bottle; macerate a week, shaking every day, and filter; dose &#189; wineglass with equal parts water a few minutes before each meal; children or very weak patients should take it after eating; it should always be diluted.
</p><p>G. Grupe, a Manila pharmacist, treating the bark in 1883 by the same process as that used in the preparation of quinine, obtained a bitter substance which he named <hi>Ditaine</hi>. According to Grupe Dr. Pina used this substance with great success in the treatment of malarial fevers, but neither Grupe&#8217;s report nor Pina&#8217;s experiment are of any scientific value, inasmuch as they have neglected to mention the doses in which the so-called alkaloid was employed. Later analyses by Hesse and Jobst revealed several principles: two alkaloids <hi>ditamine</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">16</hi>H<hi rend="sub">19</hi>NO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>), soluble in ether; <hi>Ditaine</hi> or <hi>Echitamine</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">22</hi>H<hi rend="sub">28</hi>NO<hi rend="sub">4</hi> + H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O) insoluble in ether, soluble in water; acetic acid and two amorphous substances dextrogyrous in ethereal solution, one of them <pb id="pb165" n="165"/>a resin, <hi>Echicauchina</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">25</hi>H<hi rend="sub">40</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>), the other neutral, <hi>Echiretin</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">35</hi>H<hi rend="sub">56</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>); two crystallizable principles, dextrogyrous: <hi>Echicerin</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">30</hi>H<hi rend="sub">48</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>), <hi>Echitein</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">42</hi>H<hi rend="sub">70</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>) and <hi>Echitin</hi> (C<hi rend="sub">32</hi>H<hi rend="sub">52</hi>O<hi rend="sub">2</hi>).
</p><p><hi>Ditaine</hi> is employed under the same circumstances and in the same dose as quinine. (The Hindoo writer, K. L. Dey, states that the plant yields an inferior quality of gutta-percha.)

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;In the Philippines and in Spain this plant is well known to be poisonous. The bark and the leaves of both the red-flowered and white-flowered varieties are boiled in cocoanut oil and the product is used for inunction in itch and other skin diseases. The bruised root is a useful application for chancroids.
</p><p>We have stated that the plant is poisonous, and indeed it is actively so in the tropics. It is now recognized as an energetic cardiac poison, comparable with strophanthus, destined to play <pb id="pb166" n="166"/>an important part in therapeutics. Dr. Pouloux has made a study of the hydro-alcoholic extract of oleander and reports that it exerts a marked effect on the heart of frogs and rabbits, arresting them in systole. Where there is asystolia, such as we encounter in Bright&#8217;s disease, without compensation, it stimulates the heart and increases the urine in the same manner as digitalis. No contraindications to its use are as yet known. It occasions no disagreeable symptoms and may be used many days consecutively provided that the daily dose does not exceed 10&#8211;15 centigrams.
</p><p>The poisonous properties of the plant reside in two alkaloids isolated by Lukowsky from the leaves: <hi>oleandrine</hi>, extremely toxic and <hi>pseudo-curarine</hi>, as its name indicates, resembling curare in its action. Oleandrin is yellow, semicrystalline, soluble in water, alcohol, ether, chloroform and olive oil; fusible at 70&#8211;75&#176; and changing to a greenish oil. With HCl it forms a crystalline salt. It is a violent irritant of the mucous membranes and given internally it causes emesis, diarrh&#339;a, tetanic convulsions and death. It arrests the cardiac movements in doses of 25 milligrams.
</p><p>Loiseleur-Deslongchamps experimented with the drug on his own person, using a solution of 30 grams of the extract in 120 grams of wine. He began by taking three drops of this preparation four times a day, adding a drop to each dose every day, so that at the end of 12 days he was taking 48 drops between 6 a. m. and 9 p. m. He reached a maximum of 64 drops a day but was forced to abandon his experiment at that point on account of the unpleasant symptoms induced&#8212;loss of appetite, great weakness and muscular pains. His deduction was that the plant contained a &#8220;destructive and irritant principle.&#8221; The experiment is of interest as demonstrating the maximum dose of the drug.
</p><p>The active principles of the plant reside principally in the leaves and bark, but that they are abundantly present in other <pb id="pb167" n="167"/>parts is proved by the death of several soldiers in Corsica from having eaten meat roasted on a spit of oleander wood.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;This plant is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India as an alterative, tonic, diaphoretic and emetic. J. J. Durant, having observed that the natives used it for dysentery, experimented with it quite successfully in that disease. For adults he gradually raised the dose from 1.10 to 4 grams, preferring smaller doses, however, for mild cases. To children he prescribed 5&#8211;10 centigrams for each year of age, 3 or 4 times a day. He remarked that the effects produced were identical with those of ipecac administered in Brazilian fashion.
</p><p>The part of the plant used is the dry root powdered. The usual dose is 15&#8211;50 centigrams 3 times a day, gradually increased; as an emetic 2&#8211;4 grams.
</p><p>The milky juice that escapes from the stem on the slightest abrasion is a drastic purgative, given commonly in dropsy, lumbricoids, etc. Pledgets of cotton impregnated with the juice and packed in the cavities of carious teeth, relieve toothache. <pb id="pb168" n="168"/>It is applied locally for various skin diseases, including syphilitic ulcers, and as a depilatory.
</p><p>Some races of India, such as the Rajputs of the districts of Allahab and of Khangor, use this milk-juice to poison their female infants whom they are accustomed to regard as a vexatious burden. Therapeutically they use it with honey, locally for sore throat.
</p><p>The dry and powdered juice has been used in small doses as an alterative in the treatment of tuberculous leprosy, but it has not given results any better than many other drugs. In syphilis and mercurial cachexia its results are less doubtful.
</p><p>In 1881 Dr. Riddell obtained a sort of gutta-percha from the juice, previously observed by Professor Redwood.
</p><p>Mooden Sheriff states that the most active parts of the plant are the root bark and the dried juice. He adds that the action of the juice is irregular and even dangerous, and that the bark is active in direct proportion to its age. He recommends that the inert tuberous layer of the bark be removed; prepared thus and powdered it is emetic in doses of 2.50&#8211;3 grams.
</p><p>Duncan claims to have isolated from the bark an active principle which he called <hi>mudarin</hi> from &#8220;mudar,&#8221; the Indian name of the plant. Following the same process Fl&#252;ckiger was unable to obtain the substance, but did isolate 1&#189;% of an acrid resin, soluble in ether and in alcohol; a mucilage and a bitter principle decolorized by chloroform and ether. It is probable that this is the active principle of the &#8220;Calotropis gigantea.&#8221;
</p><p>Warden and Waddell in 1881 isolated a substance crystallizable in nodular masses, with the formula C<hi rend="sub">17</hi>H<hi rend="sub">28</hi>O, analogous to the <hi>albana</hi> of gutta-percha.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;We are ignorant of the uses the Filipinos make of this plant. It is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India, the dry powdered leaf being the part employed, and its emetic, diaphoretic and expectorant properties are well known in that country. Roxburgh has used the root as an emetic and Anderson has employed it in the same manner as ipecac in dysentery. Later the experience of Anderson was confirmed by O&#8217;Shaughnessy; though in place of the root he used the leaf, the properties of which he regards as more certain and uniform.
</p><p>Dr. J. Kirkpatrick has noted that the juice of the root and its powder are used by the natives of Mysore as an emetic, and adds that he himself has used it for that purpose in a thousand cases with good results. In its effect on dysentery as well as in its emetic effect it resembles ipecacuanha. He used the powder in doses of 1.20&#8211;1.80 gr., to which he added 3&#8211;6 centigrams of tartar emetic when he desired to obtain an energetic emetic action. Like O&#8217;Shaughnessy he prefers the powdered leaves. He considers it a good substitute for ipecac, not only as an emetic, but as a remedy in asthma, dysentery and catarrhal affections; Drs. Oswald and Mooden Sheriff have made the same observations. The latter <pb id="pb170" n="170"/>advises the administration of the juice of the plant for snake bites till vomiting is produced; then follow with diffusible stimulants.
</p><p>The emetic dose of the powdered leaves is 1.20&#8211;1.80 grams, the expectorant and diaphoretic dose 10&#8211;30 centigrams. The concentrated infusion of the leaves has an acrid taste. Tannic acid, the neutral acetate of lead and caustic potash produce with it an abundant precipitate; the perchloride of iron colors it a dark green. Broughton, of Ootaemund (India), informed Hanbury and Fl&#252;ckiger, from whom we quote, that in 1872 he obtained a very small quantity of crystals from a large quantity of leaves. He had not enough to make an analysis, but injected a solution of the crystals into a dog with resulting vomiting and diarrh&#339;a.

The natives handle it with the greatest imprudence, selling everywhere in the markets and in the Chinese shops, called <hi>tindag&#771;-bayag&#771;</hi>. It is not only a remedy among them, but a sort of panacea, to which they attribute, among other virtues, that of expelling evil spirits, simply worn about the neck. They grate it with a piece of earthen pot, mix with a little &#8220;tuba&#8221; vinegar and apply it to the temples for headache. In bites of poisonous animals they advise the application of the powdered seed over the wound, a treatment which instead of being beneficent might easily be harmful to the patient. Before proceeding further, let us give the chemical composition of the seeds in order that their uses may be the better understood.
</p><p><hi>Strychnine</hi> is found in them in the proportion of &#189;&#8211;1&#189; and <hi>brucine</hi> &#189;%&#8211;1.4%. Fl&#252;ckiger and Hanbury by drying it over sulphuric acid and burning it with &#8220;cal s&#242;dica&#8221; obtained 1.78% of nitrogen which represents 10% of albuminoid material. Strychnine and brucine exist in combination with igasuric acid discovered by Ludwig in 1873. The proportion of both the alkaloids is greater than in the seeds of nux vomica which contain only .25&#8211;.50% strychnine and .12&#8211;.05% brucin, although some authors give it as high as 1.01%. Strychnine can be obtained more readily and in larger proportions from St. <pb id="pb172" n="172"/>Ignatius bean, but it is generally obtained from nux vomica seeds on account of the cheapness of the latter.
</p><p>It is more energetic than nux vomica and its use in medicine should be condemned, preference, however, being given to the official preparations among which the best known is that commonly called &#8220;Bitter Drops of Beaum&#233;,&#8221; of which the following is the composition:

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The applications of this species are identical with those of <hi>D. Stramonium</hi> and it is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India. It is antispasmodic, narcotic and toxic, and is used quite commonly with criminal intent in India and Indo-China. The cooked and bruised leaves make an efficient poultice in articular rheumatism.
</p><p>The symptoms of poisoning by &#8220;dhatura&#8221; are: dilatation of the pupil, general malaise, dryness of the fauces and skin, hallucinations, rapid pulse, coma and death or permanent mania.
<pb id="pb179" n="179"/></p><p>The dry leaf is smoked to abort asthma, and though its action is uncertain, it is one of the many remedies that should be tried, which though ineffective in one case may in another afford positive relief in this distressing disease. Not more than 1.50 grams should be smoked in one day and their use should be discontinued if any symptom of intoxication supervenes. The Pharmacop&#339;ia of India contains a tincture made from 75 grams of the ground seeds and 500 grams of alcohol. Dr. Waring states that 20 drops of this tincture are equivalent to 6 centigrams of opium and that in some cases it has given him better narcotic results than the opium. The extract is made from 500 grams of the powdered seeds, 500 cc. ether, 500 cc. alcohol and 500 cc. water. Dose, 5&#8211;20 centigrams a day in 4 doses.
</p><p>The <hi>D. fastuosa</hi>, L., known in Manila by the common name of <hi>Talamponay na itim</hi>, Tag., possesses the same properties as the above.

</p><p><hi rend="bold">Nicotiana Tabacum, L.</hi>
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Nom. Vulg.</hi>&#8212;<hi>Tabaco</hi>, Sp.; <hi>Tobacco</hi>, Eng.
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;Tobacco is a powerful sedative and antispasmodic, but owing to the accidents it may give rise to, its use in therapeutics is very limited. Like all the active Solanace&#230; it is effective against neuralgia and spasm of the muscular tissues and is therefore indicated in strangulated hernia and in intestinal obstruction. In these conditions the infusion of 1&#8211;5 grams of the dried leaf to 250 grams of water is given by enema. Trousseau advises non-smokers who suffer from chronic constipation to smoke a cigarette fasting, a practice which, according to him, stimulates defecation. For the same condition the people of southern India are accustomed to apply a poultice of the bruised leaves to the anal region.
</p><p>Tobacco has been used by enema to combat tetanus; Dr. Lesth, of the General Hospital for Europeans, Bombay, claims to have obtained excellent results by applying a poultice over the entire length of the spinal column. Dr. Dymock has confirmed this practice.
</p><p>A decoction of the leaves is used as a lotion to destroy &#8220;pediculi capitis and pubis,&#8221; and to wash gangrenous ulcers.
</p><p>The daily increasing practice of smoking, like all other subjects, divides mankind into two camps, one for and one against the habit. Both parties exaggerate their arguments. The abuse of the plant without doubt sets up disturbances of the digestion, the heart and the nervous system. It is furthermore positive that persons of a certain disposition and with certain ailments are injured by even a moderate use of tobacco. The above facts serve as arms for the opponents of the habit; the robust who smoke and drink to excess and meet with an accidental death on a railroad or from an acute disease that overtakes <pb id="pb181" n="181"/>them in the midst of perfect health, serve as arguments for the defenders, to prove the innocence of the custom. The antiseptic qualities of the smoke and of the entire plant also lend the smoker a defensive argument, as he may uphold the habit as hygienic and highly useful in preventing microbic infection. The antiseptic power of tobacco smoke is undoubted, but it is intolerable that a physician under the pretext of avoiding self infection should enter the house of his patient and continue smoking at the bedside.
</p><p>Chronic nicotine poisoning is the result of a gradual intoxication by the absorption of the active principle of tobacco, the alkaloid nicotine. Excessive smoking conduces to nicotism, more common in Europe than in the tropics, because the natives of Europe smoke the pipe and being confined in closed dwellings, breathe continuously an atmosphere of smoke; in the Philippines, on the contrary, the pipe is almost unknown and owing to the nature of the dwellings the smoking is carried on practically in the open air. An injurious practice of the Filipino smokers is that of &#8220;swallowing the smoke,&#8221; and this is a fitting point to call attention to an error of Dujardin-Beaumetz, who states that &#8220;in those who habitually swallow the smoke the nicotine acts directly upon the stomach.&#8221; The expression &#8220;swallow smoke&#8221; (<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">tragar el humo</foreign>) does not mean to force it into the stomach by an act of deglutition, and I am sure no one attempts to dispose of it in that way; but to inspire or breath it into the air passages. It is evident that this latter habit does not involve the stomach, but those who practice it expose themselves more to nicotism than those who keep the smoke in the mouth or expel it through the nose.
</p><p>The first cigar causes symptoms familiar to nearly everybody; dizziness, malaise, cold sweat, vomiting, diarrh&#339;a, dilatation of the pupils and rapid heart action&#8212;an acute intoxication. Chronic intoxication or nicotism manifests itself by disturbances of digestion, vision and especially circulation. It has been assigned <pb id="pb182" n="182"/>as one of the causes of early atheroma and of angina pectoris. It should therefore be proscribed in persons who present symptoms of gastro-intestinal or of heart disease, and in every patient who complains of slight precordial pains, commonly attributed to flatus, but in reality cardiac neuralgia, a fugitive symptom announcing the possibility of that grave accident, angina pectoris, capable of ending the life of the patient with one stroke.
</p><p>Nicotine (C<hi rend="sub">10</hi>H<hi rend="sub">14</hi>N<hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is an oleaginous liquid heavier than water, colorless, changing to dark yellow on contact with the air. <hi>Nicotianin</hi> or &#8220;camphor of tobacco&#8221; is another substance found in the leaves, crystalline, tasteless, with an odor resembling tobacco. Nicotinic acid is a product of the combustion of nicotine.
</p><p><hi rend="sc">Botanical Description.</hi>&#8212;The tobacco plant is so familiar to all Americans that its description here would be superfluous. It grows in all parts of the islands, the best qualities being cultivated in the northern provinces of Luzon, especially Cagayan and La Isabela.

The flowers, leaves and roots, but especially the flowers, possess antispasmodic properties and are prescribed in certain forms of asthma; they are bitter and slightly aromatic, and are given in infusion or electuary.
</p><p>Drs. Jackson and Dott have testified from their own experience to the usefulness of the drug in chronic bronchitis, asthma and afebrile catarrh.

</p><p><hi>V. trifolia</hi> is regarded in India as the most powerful species and Bontius has extolled it highly, calling attention to the anodyne, diuretic and emmenagogue properties of the leaves. These are very effective applied in fomentation to rheumatic joints and their use is extensive both in India and the Malay Archipelago. A decoction of the leaves is used locally and as a vapor-bath in the treatment of beriberi. A large earthen pot is filled with leaves and water and brought to a boil; the pot is then placed under a chair in which the patient sits enveloped <pb id="pb193" n="193"/>in a sheet or blanket. If necessary the pot may be removed 2 or 3 times, heated and replaced until abundant sweating is induced. An apparatus to conduct the steam under the chair would be much handier, but it is unsafe to place a small stove or lamp under the chair for fear of setting fire to the cloth.
</p><p>In India and the Philippines there is a peculiar inflammation localized in the soles of the feet and characterized by an intense burning rather than pain, not described in the textbooks, but called by the natives &#8220;burning of the feet&#8221; (&#8220;quemadura del pi&#233;&#8221; or &#8220;ignipedites&#8221;); in our own experience and according to the consensus of the physicians of India, the application of these leaves 3 or 4 times a day to the soles of the feet has afforded marked relief. The leaves are heated in an earthen pot without the addition of water, and when sufficiently hot are applied and held in place by a bandage.
</p><p>Dr. W. Ingledew states that the natives of Mysore (south of India) treat rheumatism and febrile catarrhs by steam baths of the decoction of vitex. A decoction of the leaves is in common use in the Philippines, Malay Islands and India as a bath for women in the puerperal state.
</p><p>The dry leaves are smoked for headache and catarrh. According to creditable authority the application of the heated leaves in orchitis produces good results. The root is tonic, febrifuge and expectorant and the fruit nervine and emmenagogue according to the Sanscrit writer.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;This plant is a native of Mexico. It has a peculiar, somewhat offensive odor and an acrid, aromatic taste due to an essential oil resembling peppermint (?). According to Padre Mercado, &#8220;When the seeds are taken with wine, sensation is so dulled that the drinker may be whipped without feeling the lashes, and even if put to the torment, does not feel it.&#8221; These properties, if true, make this plant one of the most useful in the Philippines. The entire plant is stimulant. The infusion, given internally, causes sweating, excites the circulation, is diuretic, tonic, stomachic, and useful as well as an antispasmodic in nervous troubles. The leaves are employed in making the infusion, 8 grams to 200 of boiling water. It is widely used in bronchial catarrhs and in asthma on account of its sudorific and expectorant action. It seems also to possess emmenagogue properties. The seeds yield on distillation a yellow essential oil with a strong and disagreeable odor, density 0.908. Both seeds and flowers are vermifuge, and are used as such in Brazil in doses of 8 grams in infusion or with an equal dose of castor oil.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The root has a wide use in medicine in the Philippines; it is bitter, of a nauseating odor and has the reputation of being a powerful antidote for the bites of poisonous serpents and insects. It has further use in the treatment of malarial fever, in dyspepsia, and in the flatulent colic of teething children. It is regarded as tonic and emmenagogue. In various forms of diarrh&#339;a it appears to be effective and Dr. Gibson states that it is useful in intestinal disorders. In the Philippines it is not only given internally but also externally applied over the abdomen, mixed with hot cocoanut oil (10 grams of the powdered root to 100 oil).
<pb id="pb204" n="204"/></p><p>The first Portuguese settlers in India called the drug &#8220;Cobra Root,&#8221; because the natives regarded it as an antidote for the bite of the terrible &#8220;Cobra da Capello.&#8221; This reputation, however, seems not to have been deserved, judging from the fearful mortality in India and Ceylon due to the bite of the cobra.
</p><p>Dr. Imlach, a surgeon of Singapore, states that in one season in one collectorate, Shikapore, no less than 306 cases of snake bites were officially reported, the mortality being 63, or about 20.58 per cent. Other reports make it safe to conclude that in the entire province during the year no less than 300 deaths were due to this cause alone. Dr. Waring believes that if an antidote for snake bite exist in the vegetable kingdom it will most probably be found in the natural order Aristolochiace&#230;.

<pb id="pb205" n="205"/></p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;A masticatory, used all over the extreme Orient, is composed of the leaves of this plant, a little slaked oyster-shell lime and a rounded slice of the bonga or areca nut; the Filipinos call this combination <hi>bayo</hi>, though the name is not of native origin; the Tagalos call it <hi>hits&#250;</hi>. The use of buyo by careless persons is decidedly repugnant, for the mixture of the lime and the pigment of the bonga imparts a blood-red or rather brick-red color to the saliva which they spit in mouthfuls into the streets and other public places with no thought of the feelings of others. Unless the mouth is carefully cleaned the teeth become encrusted with a sort of black enamel and the breath assumes a detestable odor. When used in small quantities and with proper toilet of the mouth, and this is the common practice among the Filipinos, buyo seems to be a very useful preservative of the teeth and a gingival and stomachic tonic. These properties are readily understood when we consider that the lime is antacid, the bonga astringent and tonic and the betel aromatic and stimulant.
</p><p>The buyo leaf plays a very important part in the therapeutics of the infant of the Philippines: in its indigestions, colics and diarrh&#339;as the heated leaves are applied to the abdomen previously anointed with hot cocoanut oil. In bronchitis and laryngitis the heated leaves are applied over the chest or neck after rubbing the parts with oil. It undoubtedly produces good effects and the physicians of India recommend it in the same cases and in the same form as in the Philippines. Applied to the breasts of parturient women it dries up the milk and in the same way tends to reduce any glandular enlargement.
</p><p>Dr. Kleinst&#252;ck of Java recommends the essence of the leaves in all sorts of catarrhs and as an antiseptic in doses of one drop to 140 of the vehicle. This essence is obtained by distillation; it is dark in color, has an acrid taste and an odor resembling that of tea. Its density is 1.020.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The berry-like fruit of the pepper is more extensively used as a condiment in cooking than in the treatment of disease. Used in moderation, however, it is of considerable value as a convenient stomachic and aid to digestion in tropical countries where the digestive functions readily become sluggish. Its abuse may lead to serious consequences, such as inflammation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, of the portal system and the liver itself.
</p><p>Pepper is used as a febrifuge in the various forms of malarial fevers, in the form of granules of 8 or 10 berries in a cup of brandy and anise (Spanish); this is taken by the patient in one dose at the beginning of the cold stage and followed by large quantities of water to relieve the thirst caused by the pepper. This treatment causes the cold stage to rapidly subside and more rapidly induces and intensifies the sweating stage. It is said that no further attack of fever follows.
</p><p>Piperin (C<hi rend="sub">17</hi>H<hi rend="sub">19</hi>NO<hi rend="sub">3</hi>) is febrifuge and is given in pill form internally in doses of 30&#8211;60 centigrams; the action of the crude drug is evidently due to this neutral principle.

</p><p>This decoction relieves the most obstinate asthma, as well as cough and bronchial irritation. It is necessary to use the entire plant. The decoction is usually given in the morning, fasting, in the middle of the afternoon and at bedtime. In very stubborn cases another dose may be given in the middle of the night. Frequently the relief is immediate and in some cases a liter of the decoction is enough to effect a cure. If the symptoms return, it is easy to abort them; they are less distressing and, according to the statements of patients, the medicine &#8220;gives them air.&#8221;

</p><p>The root is regarded in India as an antidote for snake bite and, indeed, the plant is sacred to Munsa, the snake divinity.

</p><p>The leaves contain an abundance of milky juice, acrid and very active, used in the treatment of several skin diseases. Like the species <hi>E. pilulifera</hi> it possesses antiasthmatic properties; Dr. S. C. Amcobury reports 6 cases treated with satisfactory results. Owing to the acrid quality of the juice great care should be maintained both in its internal and external use. The Sanscrit authors regard it as purgative and usually administer <pb id="pb213" n="213"/>it with other drugs of the same action to increase its effect. Ainslie states that the native herb-doctors of India give the juice in intestinal obstruction and in the &#339;dema of malarial cachexia. The dose is 1.25 grams in 24 hours given in 300 cc. of sweetened water in divided doses. This dose is, in my opinion, dangerous; 40&#8211;60 centigrams a day is more prudent.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The milky juice of the trunk and branches is a drastic purgative, too active for safety as a physic. Mixed with water it is used as a wash for atonic ulcers.
</p><p>The seeds yield 25&#8211;30 per cent. of a yellowish oil, more active than castor oil as a purgative but less certain. Ten or <pb id="pb216" n="216"/>twelve of the former equal in effect 30 to 40 drops of the latter. Its density is 0.919, and it differs from castor oil in being only slightly soluble in absolute alcohol. In some parts of the Philippines it is used for purposes of illumination, and it is exported to Europe to adulterate soaps and candles. It contains a little stearin which begins to be deposited at 9&#176; and is entirely solidified at 0&#176;.
</p><p>The fruit is strongly purgative, and this action is not due to the oil but to a peculiar resin so active that 3 fruits produce drastic effects. Whatever purgative action the oil possesses is due to the resin which it contains in solution. It seems, therefore, preferable to treat the seeds with alcohol, thus dissolving the resin, and use the tincture thus obtained in place of the oil.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;This plant is not used medicinally in the Philippines, but is very common in India. Dr. G.

Like ipecacuanha it seems to have little tendency to act on the bowels or depress the vital powers, and it decidedly increases the secretion of the pulmonary organs. Probably an infusion of the dried leaves or an extract prepared from the green plant would retain all its active properties. The dose of the expressed juice for an infant is a teaspoonful.
</p><p>Dr. A. E. Ross speaks highly of its use as an expectorant, ranking it in this respect with senega; he found it especially useful in the bronchitis of children. He also makes favorable report of a cataplasm of the leaves as a local application to syphilitic ulcers and as a means of relieving the pain attendant on the bites of venomous insects.
</p><p>The alleged purgative action of the root noticed by Ainslie is confirmed by Dr. H. E. Busteed, who reports having used the expressed juice of the root and leaves as a laxative for children.
</p><p>Langley, a military surgeon, states that in Canara the natives employ the leaf juice in congestive headache, soaking pledgets of cotton with it and introducing them into the nasal foss&#230;; the resultant nose bleed relieves the headache. The powder of the dry leaves is dusted on ulcers and putrid sores. In asthma <pb id="pb220" n="220"/>and bronchitis, both of children and adults, Langley has used this plant with good results, and he recommends 1.25&#8211;3.50 grams of the tincture (100 grams of the fresh plant to 500 of alcohol, 90&#176;) repeated several times a day; the effect is expectorant, nauseant and, in large doses, emetic.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The capsular fruit of this plant is thickly beset with reddish glands and hairs, which, when brushed off and gathered in powder form, constitute the <hi>kamala dye</hi> of the Hindoos. It was mentioned by the Arabian physicians of the tenth century under the names of <hi>Kanbil</hi> and <hi>Wars</hi>. In India the powder is highly valued as a yellow dye-stuff for silk. Medicinally it <pb id="pb221" n="221"/>is used as an anthelmintic, the English physician Mackinnon, of the Bengal Hospital, having been the first to scientifically prove this property; he reported that it was successful in expelling the tape-worm. It is now official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India and also in the U. S. P. as an anthelmintic and purgative; in Switzerland it is commonly given to expel the bothriocephalus which abounds there, the lake fish acting as hosts.
</p><p>The dose recommended by the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India is 8&#8211;12 grams, divided in 3 or 4 doses. This amount sometimes causes nausea and colic; in the third or fourth stool the t&#230;nia is commonly expelled in a lifeless condition. Dujardin-Beaumetz advises a dose of 30 grams of castor oil in case the t&#230;nia has not been expelled 2 hours after the last dose of kamala. The powder is efficacious but the tincture seems to be surer; the dose is 6 grams for children and 20 for adults, given in divided doses in aromatic water every hour for 6 hours. This tincture is prepared by macerating 200 grams of kamala in 500 cc. alcohol for 7 days; then filtering with expression and adding enough alcohol to complete the 500 cc.
</p><p>The powder is also used in India as a local application in herpes circinata. It is insoluble in water; in ether and alcohol it yields 80% of a red resin.

It operates mechanically in the intestinal tract and its action is rapid and is indicated whenever it is desired simply to empty the intestines without producing any irritating effect; it is, therefore, a purgative indicated in diseases of children, in pregnancy, and in hemorrhoidal congestions where a non-irritating evacuation of the rectum is desired. It is an anthelmintic, though not ordinarily given alone, but in combination with other drugs of a purely anthelmintic action, the object being to expel the worms which have been attacked by the specific.
</p><p>Oil extracted simply by expression is less purgative than that obtained by treating the seeds with bisulphide of carbon and absolute alcohol; also less purgative than the seeds themselves, because it contains only a very small proportion of a drastic principle existing exclusively in the seeds; this principle is completely dissolved in the oil extracted by chemical process.
</p><p>It is pale yellow in color, very viscid, with a characteristic mouldy odor. The purgative dose is 10&#8211;30 grams. A small dose may purge as actively as a larger one provided that the patient drink abundantly after the administration of the drug. The best method of disguising its taste is by giving it in half a cup of very strong, hot coffee. Just before the dose, take a swallow of coffee to disguise the taste even more effectually.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The fruit produced by the various varieties of the banana plant constitutes one of the most wholesome and delicious of foods, appreciated by natives and Europeans alike. According to Boussingaul its nutritive value is greater than that of the potato and it may be used constantly without ill effects. Bananas contain a large percentage of sugar and mucilage. In India they dry them in the sun, as figs and grapes are treated in other countries and thus preserve them for long voyages by sea or land; eaten in conjunction with animal food they are a strong preventive of scurvy. If eaten when thoroughly ripe they have a laxative effect.
</p><p>The young and tender leaves are used in the Philippines as a protective dressing for ulcers, dermatitis, burns and cantharidal or other artificial blisters. Before applying to the affected surface the leaf is heated to make it more flexible and coated with a thin layer of cocoanut oil or other fatty substance.
</p><p>In the dispensaries of India they also use the leaves in this way, thus protecting and at the same time maintaining the moisture of the part. Dr. Waring recommends the practice and Dr. Van Someren follows it in the application of water dressings, having substituted banana leaves for gutta-percha.
<pb id="pb228" n="228"/></p><p>In Mauritius the fruit is used for dysentery, and the flowers, together with an equal quantity of those of <hi>Spilanthes Acmella</hi>, are made into a decoction and prescribed for dropsy.

Its flavor is extremely agreeable, much appreciated in Europe by the English who are the greatest consumers of the condiment. In the Philippines a decoction is made of ginger and brown sugar, called <hi>tahu</hi> by the Chinese who drink it regularly as we do coffee in the early hours of the morning. It is an excellent drink, aromatic, tonic, stomachic and stimulant, and would probably be highly useful as well as economical as a part of the ration of European and native troops in the field. Hot <hi>tah&#250;</hi> or <hi>tahu</hi> is an active diuretic; and during the last epidemic of cholera in Manila some physicians used it with very satisfactory results.
</p><p>Ginger is a good carminative and is official in the pharmacop&#339;ias of Europe, America and India. It is used with good effect in flatulent colic, atonic diseases of the intestines so common in the Philippines and in chronic rheumatism.
<pb id="pb229" n="229"/></p><p>The tincture is given in doses of 2&#8211;4 grams. The official infusion 30&#8211;60 grams.
</p><p>The rhizome contains a volatile oil<note n="1">European analyses make the amount 1&#8211;2.2 per cent.</note> (25 per cent.), a pale yellow liquid, specific gravity 0.878, the odor like that of the rhizome but lacking its strong and piquant taste.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses</hi>.&#8212;The yellow rhizome called by some <hi>azafr&#225;n</hi> (saffron), is used as a condiment; its odor is remotely suggestive of vanilla. The Philippine herb-doctors give it internally for h&#230;moptysis, externally as a plaster or in infusion for acute dermatitis. The juice is prescribed in doses of 30&#8211;60 grams in bronchial catarrh. In India they inhale the fumes of burning turmeric paper for coryza, and with good effect according to the testimony of Dr. Waring.
</p><p>The drug is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India. It is carminative, stimulant and probably antiseptic. Its decoction is used as an eye-wash in catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis. The Mohammedans of <corr sic="Decan">Deccan</corr> use it for jaundice upon the <pb id="pb230" n="230"/>theory that the yellow color of the skin in that disease is an indication for a remedy of the same color. The juice is also used in many parts of India to stain the face, nails and other parts of the body.
</p><p>The tincture is prepared by macerating 30 grams of bruised rhizome in 200 cc. alcohol for seven days, then filtering. Turmeric paper is prepared by impregnating unsized paper with this tincture, and then drying. Both tincture and paper are used to test for alkalies.
</p><p>The rhizomes contain a pigment called curcumin, an essential oil and f&#230;cula. Curcumin (C<hi rend="sub">14</hi>H<hi rend="sub">14</hi>O<hi rend="sub">4</hi>) is crystalline, yellow by direct light and blue by reflected light; it was studied by Jackson and Menke.
</p><p>In the Philippines it is used extensively as a diaphoretic and emmenagogue and in icterus, intestinal colic and dysmenorrh&#339;a; externally for skin diseases, contusions and atonic ulcers.
</p><p>Gubler regards it as a diffusible stimulant. Its use is more extensive in England than in France and Spain; in India it forms an ingredient of <hi>curry</hi>, called <hi>car&#237;</hi> in Manila.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Uses.</hi>&#8212;The seeds form part of a masticatory very common throughout the extreme Orient, known as <hi>Buyo</hi> and composed of a betel leaf, a little slaked lime, and a slice of the fruit of the bonga, known as <hi>Siri</hi> in Indo-China and among the Malays. It is so common that it is hard to find a man or woman who does not use it. The saliva of those who use it is red and of a strong odor, and its careless use in time blackens the teeth and makes the breath extremely disagreeable. Habitual chewers consider it a tonic of the mouth and stomach and a <pb id="pb235" n="235"/>general stimulant as well. It probably does possess these properties but they are reversed in the case of persons who use it immoderately for they lose appetite, become salivated, and the whole organism degenerates. The carbonized and powdered fruit is used as a dentifrice but its virtues are doubtless identical with those of any vegetable charcoal, <hi>i. e.</hi>, absorbent and antiseptic.
</p><p>One unaccustomed to the use of bonga and chewing it for the first time, usually experiences a most disagreeable combination of symptoms; constriction of the &#339;sophagus, a sensation of heat in the head and face, the latter becoming red and congested; at the same time dizziness and precordial distress are experienced. The same phenomena occur in certain persons after eating palmito salad or the tender central portion of the bonga and of other palms.
</p><p>The flowers are eaten in salad like the above-mentioned <hi>palmito</hi>. The seed is astringent and t&#230;nifuge; for the latter purpose it is given internally as a powder in a dose of from 16 to 24 grams. Its action is uncertain. The catechu which is obtained in India from the Bonga differs from that obtained from the <hi>Acacia Catechu</hi> and is a tonic analogous to rhatany and cinchona.
</p><p>The seeds contain about 14% of a fatty crystalline material which melts at 39&#176;, and after saponification yields a crystalline, fatty acid that may be regarded as a mixture of lauric and muriatic acids. They also contain about 14% of a red, amorphous tonic material which, after drying, is but slightly soluble in cold or hot water.
</p><p>The lower part of the petiole of the leaves is thin and broad, ensheathing the trunk, is as tough as pasteboard when dry and is used in the Philippines as wrapping paper; Dr. Bholanauth Bose and other physicians of India use it as a material for splints in fractures, a practice which might well be imitated in Manila and especially in the country.

The stalk is then cut and a bamboo vessel called a <hi>bomb&#243;n</hi> is hung to receive the sap which escapes during the night. This liquid is valuable as a drink for those who are debilitated, suffering from pulmonary catarrh, and even for consumptives, who are accustomed to drink it every morning, sometimes with marvelous results, according to reports. The heat of the day rapidly ferments the tuba, converting it into a mild vinegar, which is widely used for domestic purposes in the Philippines. When fermented and distilled it produces a weak alcohol of disagreeable taste called coco-wine.
<pb id="pb237" n="237"/></p><p>The ripe fruit contains a rather soft and savory meat which is generally eaten mixed with the clear, sweet coco-nut milk. Later the meat becomes firmer and is used as a food and an oil much used in the islands is extracted from it. To extract the oil the meat is grated and pressed until all the juice is extracted. This is called the milk and when boiled is converted almost completely into oil. Cocoanut milk has an agreeable taste and may in some cases take the place of cow&#8217;s milk. It is apt to produce diarrh&#339;a, however, which action may be bad for some but on the other hand good for others, such as the habitually constipated. Both the meat and the milk are widely used by the natives in making sweets.
</p><p>In the greater part of the islands it is the only oil used for illumination. As a medicine it is employed internally as a purgative and externally in the treatment of scores of troubles in which the good results obtained are due, not to the oil but to the massage used in rubbing it in. It has the reputation of stimulating the growth of the hair and all the natives and some Europeans use it lavishly as a hair ointment. When fresh its odor is agreeable, but it easily becomes rancid and assumes a most disagreeable odor. In the Visayan Islands they make an oil of a nauseous odor which they call in Manila <hi>Caracoa</hi>. It is used only for illumination and by the poor.
</p><p>At a temperature of 20&#176; or more the oil remains liquid; it is colorless when fresh and properly extracted. It solidifies at 18&#176; and two kinds of soap are made of it; one soft and exceedingly cheap called &#8220;Quiapo&#8221;; the other hard, white, of a high quality, but as a rule containing an excess of lime which in time is deposited in a fluorescent film on its surface.
</p><p>In India the root is employed in the treatment of dysentery.

</p><p>Like the coco and following the same process the nipa yields a liquid also called tuba and possessing properties identical with those of the former plant. The weak alcohol distilled from it has some repute in the treatment of conjunctivitis, for which purpose a few drops are mixed with a small quantity of water and the eyes are washed with it several times a day. This alcohol, improperly called wine of nipa, has a characteristically unpleasant odor which makes it impracticable for medicinal or industrial use. Several chemists have attempted to remove the characteristic odor from nipa alcohol, but their results had always been negative because the odorous principle was distilled over at the same temperature as the alcohol. Finally a distinguished Filipino chemist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, perfected a process of producing from the nipa tuba an absolute alcohol perfectly free from the characteristic odor; an alcohol, in fact, possessing all the qualities of chemically pure alcohol, and of such a high grade that it was awarded the first prize at the last World&#8217;s Fair in Paris.
